# WeDance

WeDance is a participatory network that empowers dance communities by providing an inclusive platform where every member can be both creator and participant. Moving beyond traditional social networks, it creates a truly collaborative ecosystem that solves critical challenges like information fragmentation, event discovery, and partner finding.

## 🎯 Mission

- Transform traditional consumer-creator relationships into collaborative partnerships
- Enable democratic access where anyone can organize events or share knowledge
- Create value alignment through transparent, community-driven governance
- Foster bidirectional creation where every member can be both teacher and student

## 🌟 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3
- **Backend**: Node.js + Prisma + tRPC
- **UI Components**: Vue Shadcn
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Form Handling**: VeeValidate + Zod

## 📦 Prerequisites

- [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Prettier Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- **Windows Users**: Use Gitbash terminal in Cursor

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wedance/v4.git
cd v4
```

2. **Build the project**

```bash
make build
```

This command will:

- Check for required prerequisites and install them if missing (Node.js, PNPM, etc.)
- Set up environment files
- Start the database
- Install dependencies
- Set up the database with required extensions
- Generate Prisma client

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
make start
```

4. **Import data (optional)**

```bash
make import
```

5. **Access the application**

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Troubleshooting

- **Error 500: Invalid `prisma.$queryRaw()` invocation**: Raw query failed. Code: `42883`. Message: `ERROR: function ll_to_earth(numeric, numeric) does not exist HINT: No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.`

  - This should be automatically fixed by the `make build` command which installs the required database extensions
  - If you still encounter this error, run: `make setup-db` to reinstall the database extensions

- **Warning when running `pnpm cli import`**: Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.

  - Uncomment `tsconfig.json` in the cli directory

- **Prerequisites installation fails**: If automatic installation of prerequisites fails:

  - Install the missing prerequisites manually following the links in the Prerequisites section
  - Then run `make build` again

- **Docker issues**: If you encounter issues with Docker:
  - Make sure Docker Desktop is running
  - Try restarting Docker Desktop
  - Run `docker compose down` and then `make build` again

## 📁 AI-First Development

After cloning the repository, open it in [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) for an AI-first development experience:

1. Toggle AI Pane (Cmd + I)
2. Go to Cursor Settings -> Models -> Check "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
3. Open Composer Tab
4. Switch model to "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
5. Switch to agent
6. Say "hi" to start your onboarding

After your onboarding round complete, you type "hi" and get the following prompt:

```
Would you like to:

1. Review today's priorities?
2. Check pending decisions?
3. Get updates on recent changes?
4. Switch to a specific expert?
```

We don't use any ticketing system, AI will tell you what to do next.
AI will act like your personal secretary, answer any questions about business, design, architecture, etc.
