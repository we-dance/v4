  In Antillean French Creole, Zouk means party!


  Zouk is both a dance and a type of music. Zouk is danced to a slow-quick-quick rhythm, the strong beats and therefore longer steps being on the first third & fourth beat of the bar.


  The music has a boom-tick-tick feel to it, the tick-tick, being syncopated or cut beats. Some dancers dance all three beats, taking a long step on the boom and two quick and short steps on the tick-tick, or 1-2-3 or slow-quick-quick.


  Caribbean dancers are said to omit the first tick and dance to boom-tick, boom-tick, or 1-2, 1-2 or slow-slow, slow-slow with a distinct pushing down on the weighted foot accompanied by a sway of the hips (check out the Zouk videos). Zouklove is danced to slower music and it is a more dramatic and sensual style of Zouk.


  Zouklove has its origins in a slow tempo form of cadence sung by Ophelia Marie of the Dominica. Zouklove in turn influenced an African genre of Zouk called Kizomba which developed in Angola and Cape Verde.
history: >
  Zouk is a musical movement and dance pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav' in the early 1980s. It was originally characterized by a fast tempo (120â€“145 bpm), a percussion-driven rhythm, and a loud horn section. Musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe eventually added MIDI instrumentation to their compas style, which developed into a genre called zouk-love. Zouk-love is effectively the French Lesser Antilles' compas, and it gradually became indistinguishable from compas.
