  FIESTA DOMINICANA GRAND EDITION 2024

  Dates - 20th to 22nd December 2024


  We are so happy and excited to welcome you to the biggest celebration of Bachata y mas in Germany with a splash of Christmas!

  We have Bachata, Merengue, Bolero, Son, Dembow, Salsa y mucho mas!


  Location - Cologne, Germany

  Workshops Location - ToR 28, Machabäerstr. 28

  Party Location - Tanzschule Tanzraum, Salierring 33

  Both locations are well connected from each other and are only 10 - 15 minutes away from each other (by car, tram, bicycle / e-scooter or taxi)

  We recommend looking for hotels near the workshops location to have more ease and flexibility along with more number of options but anywhere close to either of the locations works great too :-)


  We are always striving to bring you high quality education!
