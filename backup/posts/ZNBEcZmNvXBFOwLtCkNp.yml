  Dance between Dimensions (by Elo & Melissa) is about getting from the head into the body and then into the heart. The marathon will therefore start with a connection workshop all together to tune into the weekend. This workshop will help you to get even more in touch with yourself and the connection with the group. Our goal is that you can more easily tap into a "flow feeling".



  Schedule:


  There will be an optional Zouk pre-party on Thursday evening.


  Depending on the weather, the party will take place outside at the river or at the marathon venue.
