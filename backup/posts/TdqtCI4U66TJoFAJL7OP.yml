  Zouk Gostosinho Team 🌟



  ZOUK GOSTOSINHO FESTIVAL 2024


  😃🌟😃 ANNOUNCEMENT!!! 😃🌟😃


  Marcello's vision for Zouk Gostosinho continues, and we couldn't be more excited for this year's edition! We've been busy making numerous changes to ensure that Zouk Gostosinho Festival 2024 offers you an unforgettable experience. Here, you'll find our stance, our intentions, and the story behind why this event exists.

  Zouk Gostosinho was born from Marcello's vision to celebrate the essence of Zouk and to establish a festival that embodies the original spirit of the dance – one that's "gostosinho," translated as "yummy." By this, he meant it should be laid-back, invigorating, liberating, and, above all, fun. Zouk isn't about performance pressure, achieving the perfect figures, or executing acrobatic moves; it's about the feeling it evokes. It's about joy, connection with wonderful people, and opening your heart because here, everyone is encouraged to embrace their authenticity and show their uniqueness. 💃❤️🕺


  This is why Marcello invitates Renata and Jorge every year to this event. They were his initial instructors for over a decade in Rio, and Renata is recognized globally as the queen of Zouk. The reason why this beautiful dance is in our lives owes much to Renata's dedication in its early days, her role in its development, and her unwavering commitment to the Zouk vision. Zouk holds a familial essence, and Marcello as dancer and teacher basically grew up with Renata and Jorge; they hold significant personal value to him. This familial atmosphere is what defines Zouk – it's a sense of belonging to a larger family. We also celebrate the dance's evolution over time, which is why we invite various artists to showcase its versatility and demonstrate how differences can coexist harmoniously. 👑✨


  This year, Marcello has chosen to collaborate with Dance Between Dimensions (Elo and Melissa) as main organizers because their work stands very much for a safe space and a heart-based experience. Some of you may have attended their Connection Training or other events, experiencing firsthand the uplifting energy they cultivate in their events.


  We've all come together to back Marcello's vision for Zouk Gostosinho. Meli, Marcello's dance partner and a big influencer in the Bonn Zouk scene, also known now for teaching at various festivals, will be main organizer aswell. And we're excited to share that Judith, co-organizer of Zaheylu Festival, is bringing her know-how and passion to Zouk Gostosinho too. Together, as a team of five, we're all about taking Zouk Gostosinho to new heights. Our main goal? Keeping the festival true to its roots – a place where everyone feels at home, safe, respectful, and, of course, having a blast! 🏡🌈💥


  As a team and based on your feedback, we've made several changes this year that we're eager to share with you:

  🧘‍♂️ This year there will be an opening Connection Workshop by Dance between Dimensions to set the tone for the weekend, where all participants and teachers of the Zouk festival can come together and get to know each other.

  🌍 This year's theme will revolve around the "four elements," influencing all aspects of the event for a rich, colorful, and diverse experience.


  🕒 The schedule will be adapted with longer workshops and breaks in between.

  🔍 We, the organizing team of five, will be present throughout the festival as main points of contact for all participants.

  🧠 Elo and Melissa, as psychologist, life coaches, and embodiment experts, will be available to address emotional topics.

  🌿 An optional closing ritual on Sunday will provide a grounding conclusion to the festival.


  🙌 We'll have a dedicated team of helpers, briefed and ready to assist you with anything you may need throughout the event.

  🕺💃 We've carefully curated our lineup of instructors, inviting only those we know and trust personally, ensuring they align with the Zouk Gostosinho vibe.


  Our heartfelt desire is to provide you with a magical and unforgettable experience, leaving you nourished, uplifted, and brimming with inspiration as you head home.

  To all who have read this far, thank you for your time and attention. We value your commitment and trust. 🙏❤️


  In the coming days, we'll share further details about the Zouk Gostosinho Festival.


  With warm regards, Marcello, Judith, Meli, Melissa and Elo 🌟💖
