  GET READY... For something extraordinary and special... Experience Zouk in a
  way you never have...

  We are happy to welcome ARKNJO & MALU from Rio de Janeiro with their ZOUK-FLOW method that has been created by Arknjo more than 20 years ago and developed steadily by both of them in Vienna!


  SHORT SUMMARY (if you don't like reading to much ;-) )

  â–º Arknjo has decades of Zouk experience and created his method long time ago, always updated to new standards and refined it with Malu

  â–º 10 hs of Workshops

  â–º Adjust your mind

  â–º Adjust your steps

  â–º Build connection

  â–º Reach Flow State

  â–º Truly for all levels (also advanced / masters can still learn new concepts)


  WHAT IS ZOUK FLOW?

  For a short but comprehensive article click here: https://bit.ly/ZoukFlowMethod


  Or here's a mini summary:

  You might think it's mainly about "flowing" continuous movements, especially the head...? BUT actually it is more about achieving a FLOW STATE in dance, means to fully immerse in the present moment.

  How can we reach that flow state and what are the techniques used to get there? ...to satisfy our real desire: to lose ourselves in the dance...


  LEVELS  - WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?

  The weekender is TRULY FOR ALL LEVELS! Also ADVANCED dancers will see, practice and experience many movements, techniques and states for the first time in their life. I teach Zouk since 2011 and I am very humbly looking forward to learn many interesting aspects of Zouk, dance, presence, flow state... <3

  IMPROVERS (in some schools called 'Beginners') don't be shy to join, but you should have learnt all the Zouk basics and have some practice... In doubt contact us!

  BIOGRAPHIES

  â–º Zouk part coming soon...

  â–º I just wanna add now that apart from both of them being amazing dancers & teachers and DJs, in my opinion Arknjo is a genius music producer. I often have Spotify play new songs to me and I check what song it is and often it's one by Arknjo...
