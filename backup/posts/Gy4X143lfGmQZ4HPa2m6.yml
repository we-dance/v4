  We invite you to dance salsa, bachata and kizomba with us for a weekend at the
  Baltic Sea. We organize open air parties and socials on the beach and in the
  Rostock city harbor and a big party on Saturday evening with 3 dance floors in
  the PWH Rostock. Our popular dancer's brunch will not be missing again.
  Wherever possible and the number of dancers allows, we will open 3 dance
  floors for Salsa, Bachata and Kizomba. We finance all indoor and outdoor dance
  locations on Friday and Saturday (socials, after parties and the big party at
  PWH Rostock) with your WE dance pass of only €20.

  The "Blue Doors Hostel KTV" is reserved exclusively for the participants this time, so that we have the opportunity to organize small socials there from Friday 3 p.m. to Sunday 11 a.m. and again our popular dancer's brunch if the weather doesn't play along. The hostel is located directly at the Rostock city harbor and from there you can quickly take the S-Bahn to Warnemünde on the Baltic Sea.

  Secure a room in the event hostel and the dance pass under "Sensual Weekend Rostock".

  , because alternative rooms are very difficult to find in Rostock in summer.

  You can book dance courses or workshops directly with the dance teachers for the whole weekend. We look forward to spending a dance-filled, relaxed weekend with you.

  The 2022 program could look like this:

  Friday

  CheckIn at Blue Doors Hostel (BDH)

  from 4 p.m. 1st beach social dance in Warnemünde on the beach

  8pm beach party

  from 23 after party in Rostock

  Saturday

  from 11 a.m. Dancers' Brunch in the BDH

  Sunday

  Of course we don't know the Covid 19 rules that will apply then. But we will always try to make dancing possible for everyone with as many open air events as possible. Nevertheless, due to the increasing number of participants every year, we cannot do without planning indoor events as a backup so that we can hold the event in any weather.
