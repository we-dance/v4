  Second best option is to fly to Dubrovnik CRO (2h drive with a beautiful scenery). There's busses going from Dubrovnik to Budva.


  Other option would be to fly to Tirana ALB airport (3h drive). We can organise transfers from/to the airport for groups if you let us know on time with how many people, dates & time. 


  The closest airport is Tivat (30min drive) but they have a very limited number of flights per day.


  ‚ùóIMPORTANT INFO‚ùó


  üÖ∞ Each pass will be purchased as a LEADER or FOLLOWER type of pass so we can aim for a 50/50 leader/follower ratio. 


  üÖ± Zouk.me! heaven is happening at the same time as Dance Festival Budva where various social dancing workshops and parties will take place (200 meters away from our venue).


  Let's dance ZOUK on the breathtaking seaside of Montenegroüåä
