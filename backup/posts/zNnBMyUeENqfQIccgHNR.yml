As the evening unfolds, gentlemen are kindly requested to approach the ladies and request their presence for the specified dances. Ladies are encouraged to keep their dance cards close and gracefully accept or decline the invitations based on their preferences and any prior engagements.


  Attire Competition: A lady of elegance shall be crowned the most splendid belle of the ball. Similarly, a gentleman shall earn the title of the most refined beau of the evening. Selection shall be vested in the hands of those gracing the occasion, through a ballot of preference. The proclamation of victors shall be executed with great ceremony, and the recipients shall be bestowed with a distinguished favour from the queen herself, concluding with an exclusive dance of victory to celebrate their esteemed titles.


  Sunday Brunch and Promenade: An enchanting fusion of Regency Era elegance and contemporary indulgence. Attendees shall savor the most exquisite culinary delights and engage in genteel socialization amidst an atmosphere of refined grace and sophistication. Following the repast, guests shall have the privilege of partaking in a dance class, allowing them to dance through the afternoon with joyous abandon.
