  We invite you to the salsa party and concert of the group FiloSofía at
  Boogaloo in Zagreb, 29.4. at 8 p.m.


  This year, we celebrate World Dance Day in style and invite all dancers, dance schools and clubs to celebrate it with us.


  FiloSofía will play their most danceable salsa songs, and before and after the concert you will be able to dance with our favorite DJ Téa.


  Don't miss the opportunity to experience this music in its full glory, because only a live band can produce such a richness of sound.


  All fans of Latin American music who want to dance and have a crazy time are welcome.


  FiloSofía is an international original salsa band consisting of 12 excellent musicians. It is recognized around the world, especially in Latin America, as an indigenous and unique worldwide salsa band that equally sovereignly rules classic salsa, as well as crazy combinations of traditional Balkan and Croatian melos.


  The dance floor of the Boogaloo Club eagerly awaits you.
