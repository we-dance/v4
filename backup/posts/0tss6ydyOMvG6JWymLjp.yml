  Salsa and Bachata dancers, you are invited to join us for a special edition of
  Latin Utopia.


  This is our Pre- Brisbane Latin Dance Festival & World Salsa Solo edition which will feature Salsa and Bachata dancing as normal plus performances by dancers preparing for the World Salsa Solo competition in December.


  This is a great way to practise what you've been learning in class. And to just relax and enjoy yourself while making some new friends.


  Performers, please take note of the Information for Performers section below.



  ** New venue**


  This year, for the comfort of the showcase audience, we are moving from Dance Culture's studio to the auditorium at All Hallow's School. 


  Benefits of this move include:

  - Comfortable auditorium seating

  - 2 wheelchair spots in the front row

  - Large stage with curtained side-stage areas

  - Professional lighting and audio (operated by technician)

  - A large green room plus bathrooms

  - 80 basement car spaces underneath with stairs and lift access

  - Open-air piazza for checking in, canapes and for meet & greet



  ** Showcase & Party Schedule DRAFT **


  NB: Performers, please scroll down to find a section dedicated to information just for you.


  6:30pm Doors open for spectators of the showcase.


  7:00pm Performance showcase (Important notes: We intend to start on-time and entry cannot be guaranteed while the showcase is running)


  9:00pm Social dancing (Salsa & Bachata) 'til midnight 



  ** Is this for me? **


  Everyone is welcome. You do not need to be a student at Dance Culture. Nor do you need to consider yourself an experienced dancer. We get more experienced by attending these sorts of events. You do not need to bring a dance partner.


  If you have no experience at all with Salsa or Bachata you are still most welcome and there will be dancers in attendance quite happy to show you some basics. You might like to check out our 4-week Introduction to Latin Dancing course: https://www.danceculture.com.au/introduction



  ** Dance styles **


  During the social dancing we will be playing two Salsa and two Bachata songs in rotation.



  ** What is it like at a Latin Utopia party? **


  Check out this video clip! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwQin_4D7Kc



  ** Who will be at the social dancing after the showcase? **


  We typically welcome 120 to 180 dancers at each Latin Utopia party. The experience level of the dancers ranges from those who have been dancing for a week to professional instructors. Dancers from all over Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast typically attend. Sometimes even visitors from interstate.


  If you have no experience at all with Salsa or Bachata you are still most welcome and there will be dancers in attendance quite happy to show you some basics. You might like to check out our 4-week Introduction to Latin Dancing course: https://www.danceculture.com.au/introduction



  ** Do I need to bring a dance partner? **


  You do NOT need to bring a dance partner. You can come solo, with some friends or within your favourite human. When you arrive just go ask someone if they'd like to have a dance! :)



  ** Finding Us **


  If you haven't visited us before you can find Dance Culture at 1st floor, 474 Ipswich Road, Annerley. We are right on the intersection of Annerley Rd and Ipswich Rd, across from 99 Bikes. 


  The door to the studio can be easy to miss: it can be found between Yesterday's Thrift Shop and Lifeline's Vintage Revival.



  ** What to wear/bring for the social dancing **


  As long as you look presentable you're all good to go. 


  Breath mints can be found at the reception desk. Deodorant can be found in the toilets. Always good to smell nice.


  Some people like to bring a change of shirt in case they get sweaty.


  If you like to drink something other than water, bring that too.



  ** How to get your tickets **


  Tickets will be available closer to the event. Please note that ticket prices will be higher than previous years due to the additional costs involved in hiring a special venue and staffing it with a professional AV technician and security.



  ** Car parking **


  80 car spaces are available on-site, right below the auditorium, and will be bookable (while available) when you purchase a ticket.



  ** Questions? **


  Any questions? Ask Avanka at reception@danceculture.com.au
