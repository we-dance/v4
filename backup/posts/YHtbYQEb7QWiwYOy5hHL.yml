  ### Why Do People Dance?


  We dance for physical fitness. We dance for mental clarity. We dance for emotional stability, and other such pluses.


  Perhaps dance is the way we express ourselves when words are insufficient. The joy we feel over new found love, the determination we have in the face of great sorrow or adversity, the passionate fire of our youth and the peacefulness of our softer and more graceful years – maybe they are never expressed more fully than through a waltz, or a tango, or a jive. We all want to be understood, and if we could truly speak the words that describe our feelings, how deep and powerful they would surely be. But alas, those words never seem to come to us just right.


  ### Start dancing in 2022!


  We have put together some courses for you that are suitable for beginners.
