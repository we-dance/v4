  Welcome to the dance celebration of a lifetime! Join us for the 6th Annual Queer Afro Latin Dance Festival, the only event of its kind in the US, where Afro-Latin rhythms of joy and inclusion unite.


  Visit our website: https://queerafrolatindancefestival.com

   ✨Festival Highlights✨

  🎤🌈 Live Concerts: This year, we proudly feature concerts by two openly gay artists, Johnny Sky and Choco Orta. Their talents and stories resonate with the LGBTQ+ community and allies alike, making this addition to our festival not just musically rich but also a powerful celebration of diversity and inclusivity. Join us for two unforgettable nights of live music! 


  🕺💃  Over 60 Dance Workshops: Elevate your dance skills with a diverse array of workshops covering salsa, bachata, vogue, heels, cumbia, hip-hop, and more. Whether you're a seasoned dancer or taking your first steps, there's a workshop for everyone.


  🌟 Speciality Workshops:  Elevate your dance journey with our exclusive Specialty Workshops, designed to bring a unique touch to your experience. Explore the art of Bachata in our Beginner Track, master the dance floor with Karel & Bruno's workshop, and find your confidence through dance with Kyla Hallums.


  These Specialty Workshops add a distinctive flair to our festival, ensuring there's something for every dancer, from beginners to seasoned dancers.


  💫 Performance Showcases: Witness the magic of Afro Latin Queer and Trans dancers as they grace the stage on Friday & Saturday night (no showcase on Sunday). Prepare to be mesmerized by the artistry and creativity that defines our community.


  🎊  Themed Night Parties: Immerse yourself in three nights of themed parties, each offering a unique dance experience. From "Taste the Rainbow - Neon Party" to "This Is Me - wear your fierce, unapologetic self" and the grand "White Party," every night is a celebration of diversity.


  🌙 New! Evening Socials: Kick off your night early with our brand-new Evening Socials from 6-9 pm on Friday and Saturday. Salsa and Bachata by Bay Area DJs, creating the perfect atmosphere for early risers who can't wait to hit the dance floor.


  🏝️ Mega Pool Parties:  Let the beats take you higher because our pool party DJ Lineup is 100% Queer! Our talented Queer DJs will be spinning a fusion of salsa, bachata, merengue, and reggaeton that will turn the poolside into a dance floor like no other.


  Stick around on Sunday for our yearly SUNDAY-FUNDAY MEGA POOL PARTY!  Hosted by the one and only Alex & Desiree!  Don't miss the legendary Pool Party Dance Competition, where you can dance for the opportunity to win a free QALDF 2025 Full Festival Pass!


  🗣️ Discussion Panel: Engage in an important conversation about "Navigating Consent and Safety in the Afro Latin Dance Scene." Explore how we can collectively create a safe and inclusive space for all.
