  ChiangMai & Pai: motorcycles are available for rent if you're not afraid to drive in the mountain.


  🛖PLACE TO STAY:🛖

  In Chiang Mai: from Nimman area and all the way to the North-gate is a good choice to pick a hotel.

  In Pai: staying in the village is the best option because it is easy to find food and cafe shops.

  We advise to pick a place that is of walking distance to 'Paradise bar' (Main venue).


  Chiang Mai & Pai are very safe places to walk alone at night.
