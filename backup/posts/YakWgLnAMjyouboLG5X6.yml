  Welcome to the magic landscape of music, dance and connection. 


  You will arrive in a lovingly held space, where we will take some time to sink in. Together we will warm up our bodies and senses with gentle and guided movement and connection exercises, inviting space, oppenness, playfulness and aliveness that you can bring to the dance floor. 


  Then, the dance floor is opened, where you can express yourselves in any way that feels right for you. You can dance alone, with a partner, or just take some time to relax and listen to the music. 


  The main style in this event will be fusion/zouk-fusion, a dance that is danced to all kinds of different music, mostly contemporary. It does not matter which dance background you have, it is about fusing styles, improvising and connecting with each other. This social dance is free of gender expectations regarding your dance role. We will have many dancers from various dance backgrounds such as zouk, tango, kizomba, forro, fusion etc. 


  In the last hour our dance will be accompanied by the talented Orlando Janke Bloch, who will take you on a journey through your inner world with floating harmonies and flowing polyrhythms.

  On the piano, Orlando Janke Bloch is creating a world, where we meet ourselves.


  You are invited to keep the space non-verbal, so you can stay present with your body and commit to wherever the dance journey takes you.

  We also recommend to commit to the entire experience so we can create a safe space, synchronise with each other before the journey starts and have the possibility to integrate the experience together.


  About Orlando Janke Bloch: 

  The musician has been composing songs since he was a child, which he has realized in several band projects.

  He continued his musical education as a singer, song accompanist and by studying music theory.


  Several cooperations with dancers lead to preformances and a first music video with fusion dancers Jascha and Lizzie. This way, dance became part of the Janke Bloch universe, as a way to express yourself, relate to the music, as an offer to connect and experience the music with more than just our ears.
