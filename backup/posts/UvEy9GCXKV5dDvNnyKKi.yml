  About the Festival


  Hosted by BB and Kiki of Salsa Reno


  A festival that celebrates Latin dancing and its music.


  To put it simply, the Reno Latin Dance Fest is a dance festival with workshops taught by professional instructors during the day, an evening dance showcase every night and then night social dancing and parties with some of the best Latin DJs, where dance enthusiasts from all over the World come together to celebrate Latin dance.


  Dance Classes/Workshops


  Dance Showcases


  Social Dancing and Dance Parties


  Jack & Jill Social Dance Competitions


  However, there is much more to it than that. It’s really hard to describe in just a few paragraphs everything that happens during the four days that encompass the Reno Latin Dance Fest. People have told us that our event has changed their lives. From the minute they arrive at “The Row” (Silver Legacy Resort Casino) in downtown Reno, they can feel the positive energy from dancers from all over the world, eager to dance and learn from some of the best in the industry.


  Beginner friendly and at the same time challenging for the experienced.


  We offer a diverse array of workshops and dance parties from other genres and styles, such as Bachata, Salsa, Cumbia, Hip Hop, Jazz, and more. We also offer dance workshops for every level, from first-time beginners to advanced. It doesn’t matter if people have danced for years or if they just started last week, we have something for everyone at a level that’s comfortable.
