  We're thrilled to welcome the incredibly talented Fran Serrano, a maestro of
  movement, as our special guest. Starting his journey in dance with Salsa in
  2013 and swiftly moving through bachata to Brazilian Zouk in 2016, Fran has
  cultivated his expertise under the guidance of renowned instructors like
  William, Paloma, Irene, Kadu & Larissa, and many more. His passion for dance
  didn't just stay within the confines of a studio; it propelled him to build a
  vibrant Brazilian Zouk community in Valencia, Alicante, and his hometown,
  Albacete, through countless workshops and socials.




  This workshop isn't just a class; it's a gateway to a community bound by the love of Brazilian Zouk. Seize this chance to learn from one of the best, connect with fellow dance enthusiasts, and add Brazilian Zouk flair to your dance repertoire.
