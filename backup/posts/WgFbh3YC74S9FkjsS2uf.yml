  June TED Retreat IV Edition 

  ‚ÄúA heart opening experience‚Äù


  Date: 14- 17 June 2023



  We are very excited to invite you to our 4th edition of TED Zouk Retreat. 


  You gave us some incredible reviews and we are very happy to hear that TED Retreats make you so happy. It‚Äôs really magical to see how you progress in zouk and  beginnings of new friendships among our dancers. You know how relaxing is our location and we can‚Äôt wait to be there again with you. 


  Disconnect to connect. 


  Our events are very different from festivals and other zouk weekenders. We are taking you away from the hustle and bustle of the city to the small countryside surrounded by forests and fields. We guarantee a very cozy atmosphere, individual approach and extremely well designed dance journey. You will leave our retreat being a different person <3. As some of our participants said - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a heart opening experience‚Äù. 


  This time we are bringing from the USA Kuna Malik again. This retreat will be divided into 2 blocks: 
   Flow & Connection in Brazilian Zouk  - in this block Kuna will work with you on creating deeper understanding & execution of connection and flow on the dance floor
  Zouk Elevation - Kuna & Joanna will prepare for you special classes that will challenge you technically. This training will bring your zouk skills to the next level. 


  As always we are preparing for you some soul touching workshops and ceremonies, nourishing zouk parties and an unforgettable cozy atmosphere :) :) :) 



  We are accepting only 50 people, so don't wait and make sure you book your spot ASAP :)

  After that we will start with an opening circle and first Brazilian Zouk Class around 5.30/6 PM. 

  The main part ends on Monday 17, June after morning workshops, closing circle and lunch around 1PM (transport back will be arranged). 



  There is a possibility to arrive to the venue one night earlier (Thursday) and stay one more night on Monday. That's when private classes, individual massages, relaxation and more socialising happen. Especially Monday evening is such a lovely, relaxing experience.
