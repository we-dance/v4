  Hello lovely dancers and those who want to become dancers,

  we will start a new Brazilian Zouk course for beginners in September. In 6 x 70 minutes you will learn all the basic steps and patterns of Brazilian Zouk.

  Ever heard of Brazilian Zouk? It is a fun, fast, slow, creative Brazilian social dance. For more info about it, have a look at zoukmunich.com.

  When?

  Monday from 17:30 - 18:40 o'clock

  05 February - 11 March (6 weeks)

  Where?

  Studio Orange at Tanzstudio Rebecca, Anglerstr. 6, 80339 MÃ¼nchen

  Registration

  https://doo.net/event/149343/order

  During the course, the regular Tuesday social is included if you want to try Zouk "in the wild". More info in class.

  For whom is this course?

  For people who have never danced Zouk before and want to learn it

  For people who have danced Zouk some time ago and want to get back into it

  For people who want to revise and polish their basics

  For people who want to learn how to dance the other role

  We only have limited spaces, so better to register rather sooner than later ðŸ˜‰

  Q&A

  1. Do I need a partner to register? - No, we will do our best to offer an equal follower-leader ratio.

  2. What shoes do I need? - In regard to the floor, suede soles work best. But you can also try your sport shoes or if you don't have anything, warm socks. Please do not dance in street shoes to keep the studio clean. Since there is a lot of turning, barefoot can be challenging especially for followers.

  3. Can I also attend single classes? - You will benefit a lot from learning the full set of basic steps. Drop-in makes it hard for us to progress. Therefore the start of the Monday course will be as a block.

  Feel free to PM us with any other questions. We are looking forward to seeing you on the dancefloor!
