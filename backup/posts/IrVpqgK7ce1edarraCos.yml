  What is a dance marathon?

  A social dancing marathon is a 100% Social Dancing event for a limited number of passionate dancers who are looking for a different dance experience to connect, share moments, and socialize, with more opportunities to dance with like-minded and kind people.

  You can dance, rest, rinse, and rejoin the dance floor later to repeat!


  Over 80 hours of social dancing in two ballrooms, Salsa and Bachata, for three days with the very best available DJs, locals, nationals, or internationals, and an incredible outdoor tropical pool party in your hotel by the Tiki bar on the poolside for everyone!

  We're expecting only about 340 participants for both of these special dance marathon events.

  We strongly recommend that you purchase your full pass early. Once we reach the number of participants, the event will be considered sold out and there won't be any additional tickets for sale. All ticket types are already published, get yours here now.

  You may also book here a 50-minute private lesson/coaching with any of our guest artists. They'd love to help you!

  Tickets are on sale now. You want this, don't wait! We're better together.


  Due to the fact that these are two separate dance marathons at the same time, you may need the appropriate ticket to go to any given ballroom. However, be assured that there will be opportunities from time to time to switch ballroom for a couple of songs, not everyone at the same time though, just to breathe a little bit and enjoy dancing with great dancers on both sides.

  Anyone with both tickets, an upgrade, or just the CDM Full VIP ticket will have total flexibility of movement between the two ballrooms.



  The event will follow this tentative schedule. This schedule is subject to change without any prior notice.


  • Friday

  The party starts at 01:00 pm til 06:00 am

  A special 2-hour masterclass on social dancing for all by Natasha Tia in the ballroom from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm.


  • Saturday

  A special 2-hour workshop for Salsa social dancing by Nery Garcia in the ballroom from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm if you book the appropriate marathon event.

  The party starts at 01:00 pm til 06:00 am

  First with a great private outdoor tropical pool party all afternoon (01:00 pm to 06:00 pm) with a Tiki bar by the poolside.


  • Sunday
