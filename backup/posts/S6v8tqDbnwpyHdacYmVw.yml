  Topics that will be raised during the workshop:

  𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲: Developing a solid technique is essential for correctly
  executing movements and preventing injuries.

  partner is fundamental. This includes nonverbal communication and trust.

  𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆: Dance allows creative expression. Explore new ways to
  move.

  𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲: Dancers need to take care of their bodies. This involves
  adequate rest, nutrition and injury prevention.

  𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Dance in constant evolution. Willing
  to learn and improve is a must.

  𝗙𝘂𝗻: Dancing should be fun. Passion and joy for dancing are important
  aspects of maintaining motivation.

  𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆: Support from fellow dancers, especially for people new
  to dancing, is very valuable.

  𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁: Respecting the body and the limits of your body and your

  a healthy dance culture.
