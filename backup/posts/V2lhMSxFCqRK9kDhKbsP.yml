  It is simple. Sign up for your Pay UR Way plan on our website and pay an upfront starter amount of $80. Then pay the rest of your ticket price in your own time, with full amount to be paid off by up to 10 days before our event (ie. fullly paid by 15th of November 2024).


  * PAY UR WAY passes are not refundable nor transferrable to another person or to another year. They are avaible from 2nd Erly Bird onwards.
