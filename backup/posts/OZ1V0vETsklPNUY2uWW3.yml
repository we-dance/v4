  CAMILLIAM ZOUK IMMERSION


  16-18 August near Basel


  This Zouk Immersion will be unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. Balancing mind and body, thinking and feeling, we will explore the most expansive and practical concepts that can be instantly applied to your dance. 


  Our goal this weekend is simple…make you a better social dancer through connecting more with yourself and others ❤️


  Get set for an incredible journey as we welcome William (US) and Camilla (Brazil) to our intimate retreat center in Schopfheim (South of Germany), near Basel! Their expertise, methodology, and vibrant energy promise an unforgettable experience.


  This immersion is for Zouk dancers with intermediate & advanced level. It is perfect for those looking to elevate their technique and social dancing abilities, bringing your Zouk to the next level in terms of comfort, flow & connection. 


  We will have 10 hours of classes with William & Camilla, 1 Embodiment Class with Elo & 2 evening socials to totally get into the vibe.


  Immerse yourself in a cozy, heart-opening atmosphere surrounded by amazing dancers and beautiful nature.  Nearby, a tranquil river flows alongside vast meadows, inviting you to unwind and take leisurely strolls or bath in the water. It's a truly idyllic setting for reconnecting with yourself, others, and nurture yourself in nature. 


  Camilla and William believe that the world would be a more loving place if there was a greater level of presence, connection, and communication between people. With over 28 years of combined teaching experience, Camilliam have found that within Brazilian Zouk, there is an opportunity to impact the world. 


  Limited spots available! This is a cozy and intimate event for max. 30 people - leaders and followers will be balanced.


  Content:

  ✅ Body awareness - bringing precision to our own body in the dance

  ✅ Flow - understanding of energy and movement and how to use it

  ✅ Comfort - bringing maximum comfort in the dance to us and our partner

  ✅ Connection - building a dance that’s unique and present with a partner

  ✅ Sensation - expanding our ability to make social dancing feel good to both my partner and I

  ✅ Concepts - no patterns, but concepts that allow us to 100x our “moves” and to not get stuck in what we think we “should” do, or what we have memorized.
