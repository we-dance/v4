  ARTISTS 🌟🌟🌟

  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔

  1- Janis and Zoe are a Bachata Sensual Couple. From the very beginning they developed their own philosophy and concepts as teachers and dancers. They created their own romantic style focussing on deep connection and true feelings with sensible following and soft leading. They also created the idea of social proofed social dancing, resumed in their concept of "social and sensual"


  2- Carlos Segura (26) from Gran Canaria and Paz Mederos (29) from Paraguay, met in 2017 at Grupo Esencia (by MarcoySara), but they have been dancing together since 2020. Paz has been a dancer since she was 6 years old and Carlos is a world bachata fusion champion. Our style as a couple is mainly based on combining our sensual bachata movements with the zouk technique that we have been learning for several years. Our main points to touch on are body control techniques to have better guidance on the part of the leaders and to have better sensitivity and connection on the part of the followers. In addition, we will provide choreographic and musical resources for a better visual aesthetic.


  3- Maycheal and Mayra are International Bachata Artists, and are also the founders of the “Dance Healing” program. Mayra is originally from Argentina, whereas Maycheal is from Lebanon.  They both started dancing at a very young age, learning many different styles and techniques. Thus, they both grew up surrounded by art.


  Mayra became familiar with a wide variety of styles: from classical ballet to bachata, from aerial acrobatics to hip-hop, from  flamenco to contemporary, and from jazz to ice skating. This latter has been a big influence on their dance,  since spins are incorporated in most of Maycheal and Mayra’s routines.

  As well as a dancer, Mayra also worked as a model and actress in her native Argentina.

  While travelling around the world, she met Maycheal at a Latin Dance festival in Lebanon.


  Maycheal has been a  Latin and Ballroom dancer since he was a teenager, and has been Lebanese Latin and Ballroom Dancing Champion. He has always been a highly technical dancer, and this has helped his teaching, something he has been doing since he was only 16 years old. With his love for teaching and a lifetime of experience, he can help students transform and rapidly achieve their goals. When Maycheal and Mayra started dancing together they incorporated tango, salsa, kizomba, as well as bachata. But their audience was particularly enthusiastic when they saw  how the bachata brought out Maycheal and Mayra’s  uniquely strong connection. So, in 2017 they founded M&M Dance focusing solely on bachata: an initiative which gave them the space to create something personal, drawing on their long and varied years of experience. In 2018 M&M Dance started travelling internationally and they won the silver medal in the American Championship, Latin open in the Bachata Category. Since then, they have travelled to more than 56 countries around the world, finding a particularly warm reception in Asia.

  Despite this success, they felt unfulfilled, and wishing to create something more meaningful, they started the Dance Healing Program. This is a program which aligns breathing with movement and mindset coaching, and includes fine technique, connection, passion, and elegance. Thus, they completed the transition from teachers to mentors.

As dancers, Erik & Katinka mix all bachata techniques in a smooth, creative & sensual style: don’t miss out on the opportunity to learn from them!

  3 THINGS YOU HAVE TO VISIT IN MALMÖ 


  1- The Öresund Bridge 

  A hub of Scandinavian ingenuity, Malmö boasts some of the most impressive modern structures in Northern Europe. The Öresund Bridge, made world famous thanks to the Swedish-Danish hit television series The Bridge, is an 8 km railway and motorway bridge that runs from Malmö to Copenhagen across the Öresund strait.


  2-  Emporia 

  is a shopping moll located in the Hyllie city district of Malmö, Sweden It is one of Scandinavia's biggest shopping malls and is situated next to Malmö Arena and the Hyllie Rail way station. Emporia opened on 25 October 2012 with total construction expenses of about 2 billion Swedish kronor. The architect of the Emporia project is Gert Wingårdh. The building has been decorated with sound design and soundscapes created by Radja Sound Design Agency.[3]


  The structure's most distinctive features are two colorful glass-clad entrances inspired by nature—an amber colored entrance pays homage to Sweden's trees and the semi-precious stones produced by their resin and a swirling blue entry that echoes a nearby strait. The serpentine surfaces of the building are jolting, but are also notable achievements in structural engineering.


  3- Turning Torso

  Built in 2005, the Turning Torso is a skyscraper located in Malmö, Sweden and was designed by the famous structural engineer and architect Santiago Calatrava. It is regarded as the first twisting high-rise building and has inspired other twisting buildings such as the Shanghai Tower (which is currently the second tallest building in the world).


  The design of the skyscraper was inspired by a sculpture by Calatrava based on the movement of the human torso, hence the name of the building. The 59-story building is 190m tall and composed of 9 box units called modules, each one consisting of 5 stories. Between each module, you have an empty floor, which creates the illusion of floating modules. One of the most distinctive aspects of the building is that it has a steel exoskeleton, something most buildings do not have. To fully appreciate the uniqueness of this building, first, we need to understand how the loads move through a building and what elements resist them. There are two main types of loads that a building will typically deal with: vertical and horizontal loads.
