  William Wegert & Camilla Magalhães is coming to Oslo. 💥


  OsloZouk is honored to have these two magical dancers coming all the way from America to share their experiences and knowledge with us 💛



  ✨ William & Camila ✨

  Born from divergent backgrounds in martial arts and Brazilian Zouk, William and Camila have found common ground in their shared love for dance, transforming their passion into an inspiring teaching partnership. The fusion of their unique approaches to dance creates a distinct and profound teaching style that resonates across the globe.


  Virginia-native William's early journey in martial arts instilled a dedication to discipline, hard work, and the art of teaching. Nurturing his love for progress and growth, he found his calling in Brazilian Zouk for its emphasis on connection, presence, and body awareness.

  Meanwhile, Camila, hailing from Porto Alegre, Brazil, was deeply influenced by the richness of her country's dance culture. Immersed in dance from an early age, she further deepened her studies by exploring the concept of energy flow within the body, developing a sensation-based, empathic approach to Brazilian Zouk. Her method focuses on teaching the ability to interact and communicate non-verbally, guiding her students towards genuine human connection through dance.


  ✨ United by a shared philosophy, William and Camila believe that dance is not about what you do, but about how you do it. They strive to guide their students towards mastery of dance, helping them achieve a state of presence and authenticity on the dance floor. They are committed to offering students the tools and techniques to become not just dancers, but skilled practitioners of their craft.


  Their dynamic partnership showcases the perfect blend of technical mastery and understanding of dance. William brings a mechanical and anatomical understanding of dance, honed from his martial arts background, while Camila offers an understanding of the sensation and feeling inherent to dance, built upon her years of exploring energy flow studies. Together, they create a unique approach to teaching Brazilian Zouk, providing a holistic understanding of the dance form.



  ✨ As international instructors, William and Camila have taught in numerous countries around the world. They've carved their niche within the Brazilian Zouk community as inspiring leaders who foster a nurturing environment conducive to learning and growing within the dance form.


  Their teaching philosophy centers around creating transformative experiences for their students. They've helped students unlock their physical potential, develop a unique dance style, and reshape their approach to dance, leading to breakthroughs both on and off the dance floor.


  ✨ Moving forward, William and Camila aim to continue growing as dancers and teachers, using dance as a tool for self-growth and transformation. They seek to foster self-love, and promote a deeper understanding of connection and intimacy through dance. As they journey across the globe, they remain committed to teaching the technique, presence, and skills that allow dancers to tap into their full potential, ultimately helping them find fulfillment in every dance.
