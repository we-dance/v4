  Hotel Olympik Artemis

  Hotel Olympik Congress 

  Hotel Olympik Tristar 


  _______________________________



  OUR OFFICIAL HOTELS - ALL IN ONE LOCATION


  Those hotels ( Hotel Olympik Artemis  & Congress & Tristar) are connected in one building so no walking around to get to workshops or parties or your bed after long night of dancing - we are all at the same place üôÇ so you only need to use elevators or stairs üôÇ


  _______________________________


  üö®‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BOOKüö®‚ö†Ô∏è



  ‚ÑπÔ∏è In February 2024 IT MIGHT happen that in part of our hotel complex (Congress & Tristar) elevators and the surrounding area will be under reconstruction.üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöß



  Thats means, that after check in on the hotel reception, you will need to use stairs to get to your room or just go out for 15 seconds, use next door and walk throw the venue and use the elevators of  hotel Artemis.



  Or go straight ahead to the entrance of hotel Artemis, use the elevators of  hotel Artemis and than walk throw the connecting corridors (available on each floor) to get directly to your rooms in hotel Tristar and hotel Congres



  ‚û°Ô∏è Basically you will use elevators on opposite side than you use to it.



  üõéDuring whole weekend there will be a paid service (hotel stuff) available, that can bring your luggage to or from the room for 2 Euros.



  ‚ÑπÔ∏è To get to the social, classes and parties from your rooms in hotels Tristar and Congress, you may again use the connecting corridors to get to the elevators of hotel Artemis. 



  Than on the ground floor on the right site you may go throw the breakfast restaurant to get to the venue (without need to go out of the hotel complex, this, this area will be opened whole weekend).
