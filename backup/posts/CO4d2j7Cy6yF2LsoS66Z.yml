  Welcome to Kiz Nature 2024!!!

  Kiz Beneath The Stars 4.0

  13-14-15 December

  The original outdoor Kizomba Festival in Southeast Asia

  -----

  Let's make this a magnificent Kiz event together!

  -----

  How about planning your wintertime with us for 2024? Spending your wonderful time before Christmas dancing beneath the stars with our kiz family.

  -----

  We have brought you more talented dancers in different styles of Kiz to keep you all enjoying dancing all night 😉 Get ready!

  -----

  This is a small event but high quality that focuses more on social dance hours in a certain style under Kizomba Umbrella than shows/performances, or even too many workshops that could be exhausted. Thus, we would love to present a relaxed dance event, especially retreating among nature, which is what we feel personally. Hopefully, you all feel the same way 🙂

  *******************************

  A portion of the ticket sale will go to support an animal shelter in Chiang Mai 🐕

  *******************************

  ⭐Venue

  Rain Tree By Chiang Dao Farm Stay (Rain Tree Camp & Cafe in Chiang Dao), Chiang Mai province, Thailand

  *******************************

  WHY DID WE CHOOSE CHIANG DAO?

  Chiang Dao has a cool winter climate with beautiful mountain scenery, awesome waterfalls, and hot springs. This matches our "be natural" concept. We have chosen one of the most stunning locations "*Rain Tree Camp and Cafe in Chiang Dao Farm Stay" for our annual outdoor Kiz Nature Festival.

  The venue is located near Yangputo Hotspring and has an unforgettable rooftop dance floor under the canopy of a beautiful raintree with one of the highest mountain ranges in Thailand as a background. Enjoy a special moment watching shooting stars 🌠at our After-party "Kiz Beneath The Stars".
