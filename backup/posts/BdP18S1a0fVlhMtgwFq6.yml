  üí†Our mission:

  NEXUS - a growth-oriented dance community focused on building a healthy and equal dance scene!

  Each of the 90 minutes workshops topic is chosen in cooperation between us and the international teachers, to help you grow as a dancer as much as possible. The teachers we chose typically are working on building their own local community, thus know what's important for students to become better! 

  Other times we will bring you the creative teachers that will provide you with the latest developments on the Urban Kiz dancefloors - to make sure you are always up to date!

  We chose to keep the size of the event small to stand against current developments in the community. With a small event size we can guarantee: 

  - better focus on you during the workshops 

  - ‚Å†good leader / Follower ratio without having to rely on guest dancers for more follower pass sales 

  - ‚Å†less lines, less waiting, less pressure - to make sure you can enjoy your weekend to the fullest

  see you soon 

  Felix & Nushin
