title: What is DANCEHALL?
community: Munich
description: >
  Hello, my beautiful people, today is the day!


  Today we will start to get acquainted with **Dancehall culture**.


  **Dancehall comes from Jamaica** (capital – Kingston city). And this is not only **Dance** or **Music**, this concept includes a lot of things (*fashion, parties, selecta, way of life, mindset, etc…*)

  But dance and music have been very important part of this culture. 


  Every week a new move is born in Jamaica (for example, *dirt bounce*). These moves are born in the streets, ghettos, parties and are directly influenced by Jamaican way of life. 


  Jamaicans are very creative about dancing, they dance about what they see or experience every day. We can even say that **dancing is a real language**.


  ## Very interesting documentary
