  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONTINUE LEARNING INSIDE OF THE ZOUK ATOMS PROGRAM!


  Once you've finished the Level 1 of the Zouk Atoms (in Bremen or online) you are very welcome to join any other of the three modules of the Level 2.


  In this module we will focus in the Position F, this means, we will be working on the atoms that are going to the front.



  FOOTWORK: In the second level we will expand the knowledge of the positions F, we will show the theory of the squares and we will train together the loops to make the learning process much easier.



  HEADWORK: If in level 1 we introduce to you the ideas of parallel and crossed system, this time we will focus on the transitions. The concept of elasticity will be important too.



  LEADING: We will continue working on the idea „leading the hips“ and will start to play with different qualitities on the contact. We want to have more control about our stepping as leaders.



  FOLLOWING: The focus of the course continue on the body position and structure. For the contact we will work on delay and elasticity.


  We are very excited of showing you all these new possibilities!



  === SCHEDULE ===

  - From Monday 8th to Friday 12th of December you will have classes everyday from 12:30 to 17:30 and the social starts at 20:00.


  - On Saturday 13th the classes are form 13.00 to 18.00 and the social starts at 20.30


  Prepare yourself for 30 hours of intensive zouk training!



  ===LOCATION===

  All the classes and socials will take place in our dance studio in the historic center of Bremen:

  Isla Zouk - Komturstr. 4



  === PRICE ===

  The full week with the training and the socials costs 290€ and we have only 28 spots (14 leaders/14 followers), so we can spend enough time with you (what we would love to do! ).



  === LEVEL & REGISTRATION ===

  You need to complete the Level 1 (in Bremen or online) to access to the modules of the Level 2.

  We cannot wait to see you back in Bremen!


  Big hug,

  WHAT ARE THE ZOUK ATOMS?


  The Zouk Atoms are a system to organize the footwork of Brazilian, allowing you to see the structure behind all the footwork possibilities and making you free to move in any direction and express yourself. Furthermore we show a way of dancing fluent head movements that makes you feel how smooth zouk can be.


  WHAT IS THE ZOUK ATOMS PROGRAM?


  The Zouk Atoms Program is a structured system to learn the Zouk Atoms in 4 intensive weeks :

  - Level 1: The entry level of the Zouk Atoms

  - Level 2 Position F: A module that focusses on the atoms that go to the front

  - Level 2 Position B: A module that focusses on the atoms that go backwards

  - Level 2 Position S: A module that focusses on the atoms that go sideways


  The Level 1 is the entry Level and a muss to continue learning the system. It can be visited online too:

  https://learn.zoukatoms.com/courses/zouk-atoms-level-1-intensive-week


  The Level 2 are three different modules that be visited independent from each other.


  After completing the 4 modules you get a certification from Olga & Fernando about your deep understanding of the Zouk Basics and the Head Movements.
