  ## Do you love to dance?
   
  Salsa? Bachata? Dancehall? Something else? 


  It might get frustrating visiting other cities as a dancer. There are secret whatsapp chats everywhere that are not so easy to get into, especially if there are no dancing friends in this city. Dance events in Facebook have so creative names in each city in local language that might take you a while to solve this puzzle. Google won't show you any interesting results. And it is useless to ask people on the street, who shy away from the words salsa and bachata, and no one knows about kizomba and zouk at all.


  What if we would have a platform like LinkedIn or Couchsurfing, but specially for dancers?


  Meet WeDance â€“ our mission is to unite dancers worldwide!


  <w-instagram url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKl792ui9uL/"></w-instagram>


  WeDance is:

  - all dances without exception (from strip plastic to bachata, from hip hop to ballet)

  - community of dancers, local telegram chat and social network accounts for each city

  - contacts of dancers by city + list of teachers + search for partners

  - calendar of local dance events

  - dance news feed and personal blog to write about dance, share your dance travel tips

  - inspiration for non-dancers to try: we bring dancers to share their love to dance and it's simple â€“ just create a profile and write your dance story


  This may be also interesting for dance organizers, because we have a very specific audience â€“ dancers and people who are interested in dance.


  We already have representatives in Germany, Austria, Turkey, and the Philippines. We would love to launch this project in every country, in every city and spread dance and love!
