  I am very glad to introduce to you our upcoming project under administration
  of www.nrwelt.com



  DANCE IT EQUAL


  Germany as a European country is a melting pot of different cultures, different languages.


  For children and young people it’s sometimes very hard to assimilate in new culture. And the biggest problem – other language.


  Such dance cultures as Afro, Dancehall, Hip Hop are aimed at bringing people together and talking though movements.


  In course of this project you will not only get access to free dance classes, but also get basic acting and performing skills, and get more confident in improvisation. At the end of the project there will be a dance performance.


  WHO CAN REGISTER:

  Young people up to 27 y.o. preferably from Munich area.

  However, as we had to transfer to online format, we welcome people from other areas.


  Who cannot register:

  People over 27 y.o. able to afford taking paid dance classes regularly.


  HOW LONG: starting 3 May 2021 – October 2021.


  STRUCTURE: dance classes twice a week + special acting seminars.


  MAIN DANCE STYLE: Dancehall
