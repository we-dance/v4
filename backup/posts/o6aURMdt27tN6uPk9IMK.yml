  ❤️ 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻! 

  Considering overcrowded festival 2023, we have decided to limit registrations. 

  We started this festival with a vision of providing you with a high level dance experience and we would like to keep this high standard experience. 

  This is why for this edition we are limiting registrations and making sure to reduce the number of dancers compared to last edition.  

  Follow our announcements, and we will also inform you in time through the promoters about how many places are still available.


  ❤️ 𝗦𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄𝘀….

  ✌️ We are opening  the grand hall for a last hour of the afternoon social dance on Saturday and Sunday. 


  ✌️ We are excited to present you for the first time new Thursday evening preparty location (incuded in all passes) Festivalna dvorana (Festival hall) which is exclusive beautiful dance hall with long tradition and perfect wooden floor and bar for socialising and drinks. It is as near as old castle location and you don't need to to climb the hill..


  ✌️ Since the venue hotel will soon be occupied, you can also check in at the Hotel Lev, which is 2 minutes away with a shuttle that we will organize during the parties, so that you can move smoothly from your rooms to the congress center where the festival is held.


  ❤️ Our artist lineup this edition is outstanding. 

  Just for you!
