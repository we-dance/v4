  ✰✰ BERLIN BALBOA WEEKEND 2024✰✰

  ☞ ☞ March 7th - 10th, 2024 ☜☜


  Registration opens on October 29th! 


  Berlin might be cold, but our four parties are hot. Berlin Balboa Weekend is back next March. There will be live music from Berlin's finest musicians, the best DJs who will play the best music designed for your dancing pleasure. Party into the sunrise with old friends and new, from near and far. Six hours of classes spread over three days for a relaxed, inspiring, and late-night-parties-compatible workshop. Taught by six of the most fun and creative balboa teachers of our time. And have you heard that International Women's day is a Berlin public holiday…


  As a happy bonus to all of this amazing information, the Berlin scene has its weekly balboa social dances on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It's possible to dance balboa 6 nights in a row, if your feet are up for the marathon! Consider coming a few days early or staying a few days longer.
