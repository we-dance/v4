  Tantra into Zouk is a concept to introduce age old spiritual practises through
  Zouk dancing into your dancing & daily life. Empowering dancers to connect to
  themselves and others on a deeper spiritual level during dancing and also
  outside of dancing!

  This is the 14th Level 1 weekend on the topic of Tantra & Spirituality into Zouk.

  The workshop will have a maximum attendance of 42 people: 21 leaders & 21 followers.


  𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐄𝐍𝐂𝐄 𝐎𝐅 𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐊𝐒𝐇𝐎𝐏 𝐖𝐄𝐄𝐊𝐄𝐍𝐃

  This will be a personal, emotional & spiritual development workshop weekend merging Tantra with Zouk.

  Tantra is the science of full self realization & the art of connection.

  When using the Tantric perspective, a couple dance becomes a micro cosmos in which you can learn and grow with each dance interaction you have.


  𝐓𝐄𝐒𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐈𝐀𝐋𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐏𝐀𝐑𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐏𝐀𝐍𝐓𝐒

  "It was very self-empowering to me! I feel like a flower that opened up finally!"

  "Sharing is caring - Thank you for teaching me how to feel and share unconditional love"

  "Awesome experience and so different to other zouk workshops."

  "An enrichment and broadening in how I view myself and others"

  "It was a challenging but very loving weekend with very profound new insights about my personality and behavioral patterns."

  "Self exploration opportunity"

  "Deep and transformative."

  "Empowering and fulfilling"


  𝐒𝐔𝐁𝐉𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐒 (𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭)

  🌿 Masculine & Feminine esotheric practises

  🌿 Tantric Meditations

  🌿 Female archetypes and how to connect to them

  🌿 Short theory on the brainwaves in which Flow (the dance trance) can occur and how to actively create it in dancing

  🌿 Dancing habits that consistently prevent Flow and how to avoid them

  🌿 Dancing habits that create Flow

  🌿 A suprisingly simply technique to make headmovements more spiritual for the feminine.

  🌿 Techniques for the masculine how to create a safe environment in which the feminine can fully surrender into dance trance.

  🌿 Techniques for the feminine how to INVITE the masculine to create a space for her to fully surrender into dance trance.

  🌿 Ancient spiritual practise that creates a deep connection within seconds

  🌿 Explanation of difference between Sexual Energy & Sexuality


  𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐓𝐑𝐀 & 𝐒𝐄𝐗𝐔𝐀𝐋𝐈𝐓𝐘

  Although Tantra has profound deep liberating sexual elements to it,

  there will be NO sexualengagement or nudity in this workshop.

  The main topic here is dance.

  Sexuality may be addressed in the theory or in Q&A upon request.

  Upon request, books and workshop references can also be provided.

  More on this, in the bottom of this description and in one of the comments.

  *************************************************************************


  𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐓𝐑𝐀 𝐃𝐄𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐈𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒

  Tantra is a very vague concept for most people. This is because Tantra is the only Spiritual tradition that fully embraces sexual energy and has deep teachings on how to use that energy for deepening spiritual practice.

  This does NOT imply this workshop teaches sexuality or that there will be a lot of sexual excersizes.


  However, the beauty of a couple dance like Zouk is that we can use the dance interaction as practice ground to learn new ways of interacting and relating between the masculine and the feminine without an actual sexual act, and even without sexual energy. The practitioner is invited to practice this in a dance setting and then to privately see if it can be put to use in personal life and perhaps personal sexuality.


  So for example, we will practice different techniques and methods on how to get out of your head and more into your body, so that you will not constantly be thinking and/or negatively judging yourself.

  Dance is perfect to practice this and it has nothing to do with being sexual.

  The invitation is to then apply these teachings in other areas of your life where you may find them useful. Perhaps in your sexlife, or in other areas that serve you.

  For this upcoming Tantra into Zouk weekend Jolien & Charlotte will be our Female Facilitator!


  𝐉𝐎𝐋𝐈𝐄𝐍

  Jolien is a certified healthcare psychologist working with people with trauma for more then 13 years. She started in 2009 with an internship at a center for people with PTSD, and throughout her career working with trauma always fascinated her.


  As a professional psychologist she has also worked with people with ADHD, Autism, Addiction, Depression and Anxiety disorders.


  She is trained and certified in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, EMDR and Mindfulness.

  Currently she works with clients with severe eating disorders.


  Body Based Therapy

  What sets her apart is her capacity to not just focus on solving the superficial problem as prescribed by the system, but to see the person in its totality. She developed a holistic approach where it is about the process of every human being, their blockages and how to bring people to the next level in their life. The importance of using the body in therapy also makes her look for ways outside of the regular healthcare system.


  Her passion for dancing and teaching Zouk since 2009 made her dive deeper in the understanding of connection with and through the body.


  When she discovered Tantra, it opened up the pathway to connect her knowledge of trauma and the human mind with body oriented modalities. She is now studying body-oriented psychotherapy, breathwork and de-armouring to help people heal energetic blockages and trauma stored in the body.


  She is a freelance Zouk teacher since 2010. Since end 2020 Jolien is also part of the Tantra Secrets team, and co-facilitates Tantra workshops, breathwork and De-armouring sessions.


  She works together with Jasper, where they offer the perfect balance in the masculine and feminine energy in massage, body work sessions and plant ceremonies.


  𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐋𝐎𝐓𝐓𝐄

  Charlotte is a trained psychologist and her passion for dance was ignited more than two decades ago.


  With a background in Ballet she explored different couples dances such as Salsa, Kizomba, Lindy Hop and finally fell in love with Brazilian Zouk. Attending Tantra into Zouk in 2019 started her self love journey in the most profound way.


  A strong commitment to integrate emotional processing tools and meditative practices in her daily life as well as exploring the roots of her own childhood conditioning, resulted in the realization of True Love within herself.

  Today she understands herself as a warrior and priestess of Love, in devotion of acceptance for all of existence. She aims to bring awareness that everything we are looking for lies within and that self responsibility is a liberating act of self love.


  In her daily life as a psychologist she works mainly with the realms of sickness, grief and death. Charlotte is also a VITA certified trauma informed Sex, Love & Relationships Coach. In her methodology she combines tools from traditional paths of psychology and somatic practices with influences of tantric philosophy.



  𝐉𝐀𝐒𝐏𝐄𝐑

  Jasper, has an extensive background in Bodywork, Tantra, Massage, Breathwork, De-armouring, Trauma release and Emotional release.


  Starting in 2012 with different forms of massage, extensive experience in Latin dance, Tantra & Bodywork, he found his passion in healing people from their trauma and unlock the body of

  energetic blockages. After in depth studies of different modalities of De-armouring and Trauma release, he started giving professional de-armouring sessions in 2016.


  Through the years Jasper also experienced the healing powers of different plant medicines (Psilocybin, San Pedro, Ayahuasca) and added this to his toolbox in healing others as well.

  Through these studies and experiences he has an tremendous amount of knowledge on how to unlock the human body to it's natural state of bliss and relaxation. His to-the-point and all-in approach helps people to dive deep into their process and get a full-on healing experience.


  Next to the workshops Jasper gives at Tantra Secrets, he specialized in private bodywork sessions where he can also combine the healing powers of plant medicine with all his knowledge on de-armouring, bodywork and breathwork.
