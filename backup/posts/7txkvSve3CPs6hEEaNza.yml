  Music Policy: We believe that most festivals have gone way too far away from what a Kizomba Party originally is supposed to be like, and we wanna be the change. We have been looking forward to being able to go back to the Roots, and in 2024 it's finally happening... High Vibe, Angolan Style, with DJs straight from "da Banda" (Angola)!! If you have already been to the motherland, you know what this means and if you probably heard of/been to Mwangolé Disco (Lisbon) - expect a lot of kizomba, semba, retro zouk, sprinkled with some cabo love, cabo zouk, afro zouk and a bit of tarraxinha and ghettozouk... Our DJs gonna make sure to keep the energy high, spiced it up a bit with other African beats from kabetula to coupé decalé, from kuduro to 80s pop - let's bring the Angolan style parties to the festivals! We think you guys are ready.. Are you Ready to go on this musical journey with us and go back to the Roots? :)
