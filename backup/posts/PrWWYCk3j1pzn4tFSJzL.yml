  In its 9th year, NYCZF2023 will be hosting a myriad of International and
  National  Artists teaching many styles of Brazilian Zouk including its origins
  of evolution. With the ever increasing popularity of Brazilian Zouk and its
  Lambada Roots, NYCZF will continue to host a diverse mix of classes from
  lyrical, improv, neo, r&b, lambazouk, brazilian zouk, lambada and more!  We
  will have a mix of intermediate advanced classes as well as our renowned Dare
  to Zouk NewComer Program.



   NYCZF2023 is primarily dedicated to educating students of all levels in Brazilian Zouk and Lambada and keeps with the mission to continuously grow BZ throughout the US by raising awareness through teachings and live performances. All instructors and artists are picked on their teaching abilities, performing talent, as well as their active and continued participation to grow zouk in their respective communities. It is especially important for us to provide some of the best talent known internationally and nationally.
