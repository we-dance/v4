  ## Tips and Recommendations for Dance Events during Coronavirus


  ### 1. Registration and check-in.


  You need a registration system and a way to notify people in case of infection happened to one of participant.


  Setup registration and check-in system.


  Ensure you can visually differentiate between people who belong to your event and those who don't. For example you can provide your guests with hand bands or stickers at check-in.


  If your event is less than 25 indoors and 50 outdoors no official registration is required. If you have more guests you have to contact [Veranstaltungs- und Versammlungsbüro (VVB)](http://www.muenchen.de/dienstleistungsfinder/muenchen/1063794/) to register your event 4 weeks in advance.


  ### 2. Rules.


  Ensure participants are aware of your rules and accept them.


  Provide sanitisers and tissues.


  **General hygiene measures:**


  - Regular hand hygiene, especially thorough hand washing with soap for at least 20 seconds.

  - Use of paper towels or regular washing of personally assigned towels.

  - Compliance with the sneeze label (cough or sneeze into the crook of your arm or into a tissue; not in hand).

  - Dispose of used tissues immediately (if possible in a bin with a lid).

  - Keep hands away from your face.

  - Regular cleaning of rooms and contact surfaces.

  - Provide foresighted refilling of soap dispensers and disposable towels, especially on non-own facilities for sufficient soap and hand drying facilities.

  - Risk groups are to be considered separately and it is based on the current recommendations of the RKI to act.

  - Anyone who feels sick is not allowed to participate.

  - Mouth and nose protection is recommended for workers in non-dance areas.

  #### Example of Hygiene Rules for your event:


  **English version:**


  - From >10 couples all must wear a mask

  - At the same time, change your dance partners as little as possible

  - Disinfect your hands often

  - Stay at home when you're sick


  **German version:**


  - Ab >10 Paaren müssen all eine Maske tragen

  - Gleichzeitig nach Möglichkeit eure Tanzpartner wenig wechseln

  - Die Hände oft zu desinfizieren

  - Zuhause bleiben wenn ihr Krank seid



  ### 3. Collaborate


  Let's do this together and share our experience and tips. Together we can achieve more!


  Since few months already I am trying to bring dance teachers and organisers together and help each other, especially during those dark times of COVID.


  **How can I help you?**


  - **Legal support**. [You might need trade registration](https://www.firma.de/en/company-formation/gewerbeanmeldung-everything-you-need-to-know-about-trade-registration-in-germany/), if so contact [Gewerbemeldungen](http://www.muenchen.de/dienstleistungsfinder/muenchen/10164604/).

  - **Registration and check-in system** – try creating your event on WeDance – see what tools we already have.

  - **List of Open Air and Indoor venues for dancing** – we have a [collaborative list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIlatnAjFGLhLgC4XAg53skymfPLqNRrvsLpqW2mX5w/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=111999679784429842999), where everyone is welcome to add more info, this way you save some hours of Googling. I would be glad to share it with you as soon as you request your access and put a username of your WeDance profile in the message, this way I can ensure only members have access to it. My plan is to provide this as a service like Airbnb where you can see available places in calendar, book and pay in one click.

  - **Book place at Pinakothek der Moderne** – we have a collaborative calendar and org chat in Whatsapp to agree about when and which part of Pinakothek is not occupied. We want also to find and test more open air venues and prepare better for the next year. This will come to platform soon too.

  - **Promo** – see events calendar. We have biggest dance chat in Telegram (400+ members), Facebook, Instagram and I am happy to repost your parties and workshops to reach more dancers.


  I would be glad to answer your questions.
