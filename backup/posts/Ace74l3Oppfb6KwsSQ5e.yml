  Easy Ways To Get To The Venue As You Stay In The City

  1. CAR POOL/UBER WITH YOUR BUDDIES

  2. Getting there with the tram. It’s a 10-minute ride from the city and it’s free! Jump on the ‘BTANIC’ line anywhere along North Terrace and hop off at the Entertainment Centre (the final stop) on Port Rd. Then it’s a short walk 750 metres to the hall: head northwest on Port Rd (away from the city); turn left onto Mary St; turn right onto Orsmond St. So easy – and the trams run roughly every 20 minutes (more frequently in peak times).
