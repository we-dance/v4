  🎉 Save the dates for the 12th edition of the Amsterdam International Salsa
  Festival, happening from Thursday, February 6, 2025, to Sunday, February 9,
  2025. Prepare for a mind-blowing experience as we unveil exciting enhancements
  for this edition. Following the success of our 2024 event, which attracted
  over 2500 participants globally, we’re thrilled to announce that the majestic
  De Koning Party & Event Centre will once again be our venue of choice.

  🕺 In response to your feedback, we’re intensifying our focus on salsa—the beloved music and dance—while dialing down the emphasis on bachata. This shift allows us to craft a more expansive dance floor tailored for salsa enthusiasts.


  Instead of having Bachata in the second big room, we’re opening it as a Salsa Romantica floor, providing nearly twice as much dancing space for salseros. If you love the music of Marc Anthony, Victor Manuel, and Los Adolescentes, this will be the place to be for you! Bachata lovers fear not! There will still be a bachata area during the parties, although it will be in a smaller room. We’ll also reduce the number of bachata workshops and use all the big rooms for Salsa workshops, increasing the dance area during the workshops.


  🌐 International Showcase on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday will start between 22:30 and 23:00 and will feature a selection of amazing dance shows by our artists. Make sure to come in early and secure your spot. There will be a limited number of seats during the showcase, which are reserved for Premium Full Pass holders.


  ⭐ Don’t miss out on the Stargate competition during the daily lunch break. Solo artists, Couples, and Dance Teams will battle to win the first prize and proclaim their spot on our main stage during the International Showcase.


  📅 Program highlights include free Pre-Party, Opening Party, Workshops, Stargate Competition, and vibrant parties with multiple areas catering to different dance styles.


  🕺 Artist Lineup:

  We have put together an incredible group of both international and local world-class instructors and performers who will be showcasing their skills not only during nightly performances but also in workshops, special boot camps, and, of course, on the dance floor during evening social parties.
