  Are you ready to take your Bachata Musicality to a next level? 🤩  


  Ronie and Frida are world renown dancers and dance teachers, with exceptional musicality skills! 😍 


  Ronie was first known as a Kizomba Fusion / Urban Kiz teacher but in past 5 years he expanded his dancing to Bachata and now he will be teaching his out-of-this-world-musicality to Bachata dancers in Helsinki for the first time! Due to the immense popularity of his classes and way of teaching, we have brought Ronie to Finland already 10+ times! 


  Frida is an amazing all-round dancer with a gorgeous style, charisma and strong teaching skills! As a teacher (and otherwise too 😊 ), she has eye even for the tiniest details! Ronie & Frida make a perfect couple, sharing their passion and knowledge with very high level of pedagogy and sense of humor! 🤩


  On Friday and Sunday, they will be teaching Bachata Fusion Musicality workshops and on Saturday there will be an Kizomba Fusion Day.


  For the Bachater@s to have an a whole Bachata weekend, we are including the Bachata Underground pre-party class and party! 🙌
