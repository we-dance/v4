  Founder of her own dance school in Cabarete, Dominican Republic, has over 12 years of teaching experience, specializing in Cuban Salsa, Bachata Tradicional, Bachata Moderna, and various African dances, including Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian influences.

  Her dance journey began at a young age, influenced by her Cameroonian heritage. Ninafrika received training in Salsa and Orishas in both Havana, Cuba, and Paris, France. She is skilled in LA Style On1 and New York Style On2 and teaches both Men's and Women's Styling.

  Mette Larsen @bachatadominicanacopenhagen

  Mette started teaching solo dancing in 2006. She fell in love with Bachata and Merengue in the land of Origin in 2020. She has since then spent +7 months on the Island, diving into the culture and dance communities.

  Her classes focus on social dancing, personal style, connection, non-verbal conversation, and the cultural background and musicality of the dances. She strives to make everyone feel comfortable, seen, and welcome when she includes her experience with Authentic Relating in her teaching method.
