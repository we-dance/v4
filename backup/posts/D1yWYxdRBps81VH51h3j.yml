  The Australian Bachata Championship was established in 2008 and is the
  longest-running competition featuring the best Bachata dancers in the country
  competing for the title of Australian Bachata Champion. 


  A line-up of some of Australia’s newest and best dancers awaits spectators as they battle it out for over $3000 in prize money and national titles.


  Each year we aim to bring you 3 quality nights of nail-biting competition along with amazing workshops and 5 hours of social dancing each night. 


  The competition is divided into two components, which are the choreography component, where teams and couples dance it out to win the best choreography prize, and the Jack and Jill Freestyle Competition, where dancers are paired up randomly and marked on their leading or following. 


  The choreography component will be held on Friday, and the Jack and Jill Freestyle component will be held on Saturday. Each night will include social dancing until late, and the Saturday night, we will have a LIVE CONCERT by the international artist ROMAN!


  We have a beautiful heritage venue in the heart of Sydney CBD which boasts a high ceiling and a large wooden dance floor that will be beautifully prepared on the night which both dancers and spectators will enjoy.


  The Championship is organised by Bachateame, Sydney's biggest Bachata night, which is led by two of Sydney’s well know Latin Dance event promoters and organisers.
