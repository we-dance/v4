  ABOUT COPENHAGEN ✨

  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔

  Experience magical Copenhagen at Christmas time, where fairytales meet reality ✨ Copenhagen is a beautiful and historical city, with several global awards for its architecture, design and quality of life. The city is characterized by its waterfronts, parks and many beautiful buildings and castles 🏰 

  In the 1800s, the city was home to Danish fairytale author, Hans Christian Andersen, which is why The Little Mermaid is one of Copenhagen’s main land marks 🧜‍♀️  

  At Christmas time, the city is filled with lights, Christmas decorations and Christmas markets where you can find many local treats, such as small traditional cakes called “æbleskiver” and the warm, spiced wine, “gløgg” 🎄
