  This class is conceived as an exploration of our inner Spiral dynamics. We
  will warm up through a guided improvisation to reach a state where every part
  of our body is well connected with our breathing and extremely articulated. We
  will bring this Spiral flow quality to the floor and then gradually explore
  new ways to dive in and out of it. A central part of the class will consist in
  playing with twists, turns, speed changes, slow motions, stops and floor-work
  moves to widen our range of movement. We will then use this vocabulary to
  build up choreographic material both on and off the floor to end up with an
  improv session, giving you a chance to share, explore and dance in your own
  unique way.
