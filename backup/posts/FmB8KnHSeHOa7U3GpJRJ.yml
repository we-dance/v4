  📖ℹ 𝗕𝗥𝗘𝗡𝗗𝗘𝗥𝗦𝗢𝗡 𝗧𝗘𝗖𝗛𝗡𝗜𝗤𝗨𝗘 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗦𝗜𝗚𝗡𝗔𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗘 𝗠𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧𝗦

  Anderson and Brenda are well known for the demonstrations of deep connection, presence and enjoyment they can express in their dance, and that comes for different reasons. They both went through a long, big, never ending journey of self development, getting deeply in touch with their mental, physical, emotional and energetic bodies. That’s probably why we can see that their way of dancing brings this holistic integration element. Parallel to this, they were already specialists of the mechanics of leading and following in many different social dancing styles they have been doing for over 20 years.

  𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲 is a technique that is being developed for 8 years and it’s still going on. It’s based on using the minimum amount of effort to make social dance comfortable and connected. “We mostly apply it on Brazilian Zouk, but it can be used by any form of dance, and its foundations are Grounding, Flow, and Lead & Follow.” It’s a technique that involves a lot of body awareness, understanding of posture, using gravity and the natural directions of the bones and joints to move with the “just enough” amount of muscle tension necessary, and has the consequence of helping the body to find its organic ways of working again. It has a lot of influence from a somatic practice called Eutonia, which is “the perfect adjustment of muscle tone”

  𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 

  These movements have different dance influences, but the principal one is Brazilian Zouk.

  On the way they understand the dance, there is a dance that happens on spot (without traveling) that allows the focus to be on body movement, internal flow and connection. And there is a dance that happens traveling on space, where they will use some of the fundamentals of Zouk.  By applying the technique into this, you can develop a dance that flows both internally in the body, and also between the partner and the space.

  At this event they will teach the most neutral way of doing above moves, and later on applying the layers of body weight, gravity, elasticity, momentum, rhythms, sending, receiving and redirecting flow.
