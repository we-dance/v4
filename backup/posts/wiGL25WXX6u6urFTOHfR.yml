  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONTINUE LEARNING INSIDE OF THE ZOUK ATOMS PROGRAM!


  Once you've finished the Level 1 of the Zouk Atoms (in Bremen or online) you are very welcome to join any other of the three modules of the Level 2.


  In this module we will focus in the Position S, this means, we will be working on the atoms that are going sideways.


  If you are a follower: The position to the side will be again a challenge for the head movements because sometimes we will be moving in very unusual ways that will challenge your body structure.


  If you are a leader: the position to the side will be like fresh air for your repertoire. The new possibilities are easy to lead, new and they make a lot of fun.


  We are very excited of showing you all these new possibilities!



  === SCHEDULE ===

  - From Monday 14th to Friday 18th of July you will have classes everyday from 12:30 to 17:30 and the social starts at 20:00.


  - On Saturday 19th the classes are form 13.00 to 18.00 and the social starts at 20.30


  Prepare yourself for 30 hours of intensive zouk training!



  ===LOCATION===

  All the classes and socials will take place in our dance studio in the historic center of Bremen:

  Isla Zouk - Komturstr. 4



  === PRICE ===

  The full week with the training and the socials costs 290€ and we have only 26 spots (13 leaders/13 followers), so we can spend enough time with you (what we would love to do! ).



  === LEVEL & REGISTRATION ===

  You need to complete the Level 1 (in Bremen or online) to access to the modules of the Level 2.


  You can register through this form:

  https://forms.gle/S864xHpZfR6iepdd6


  If you perceive any problems with the registration form, please just send us an email to zoukatoms@gmail.com


  Once we get your registration we will send you an email with the payment details.


  We cannot wait to see you back in Bremen!


  Big hug,


  Olga & Fernando

  WHAT ARE THE ZOUK ATOMS?


  The Zouk Atoms are a system to organize the footwork of Brazilian, allowing you to see the structure behind all the footwork possibilities and making you free to move in any direction and express yourself. Furthermore we show a way of dancing fluent head movements that makes you feel how smooth zouk can be.


  WHAT IS THE ZOUK ATOMS PROGRAM?


  The Zouk Atoms Program is a structured system to learn the Zouk Atoms in 4 intensive weeks :

  - Level 1: The entry level of the Zouk Atoms

  - Level 2 Position F: A module that focusses on the atoms that go to the front

  - Level 2 Position B: A module that focusses on the atoms that go backwards

  - Level 2 Position S: A module that focusses on the atoms that go sideways


  The Level 1 is the entry Level and a muss to continue learning the system. It can be visited online too:

  https://learn.zoukatoms.com/courses/zouk-atoms-level-1-intensive-week


  The Level 2 are three different modules that be visited independent from each other.


  After completing the 4 modules you get a certification from Olga & Fernando about your deep understanding of the Zouk Basics and the Head Movements.
