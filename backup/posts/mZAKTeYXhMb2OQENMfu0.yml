  Come and learn the famous Cuban dance â€“ Salsa!


  La Candela is excited to present the Beginner level course, where you could be a salsa dancer within 8 weeks. The objective of the course is to bring you to a comfort level so you could dance to the beats of salsa with a partner or in one of the many Latin clubs in Berlin.


  The course concentrates on Cuban Salsa, the original dance. We will learn the basic technique of the couple dance.


  The course includes 8 lessons, each lesson for 90 minutes. There is no need to come with your own partner, we try to start the course with a matching amount of men and women.


  Our courses are taught by professionally certified Salsa teachers. We have the structure and methodology to allow each and every person to dance. Fun times and great dancing foundation are guaranteed,  even if you think you have two left legs ;)


  No partner? No problem, we can help you with that.
