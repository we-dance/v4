  Danza Con Calma - silent social

  a place to be, relax, connect and flow with each other


  Will will start the session with a guided intro where we will arrive in our bodies and explore some ideas and ways of connecting with each other through movement and dance.


  Accompanied by sprinkles of the piano and moving musical landscapes we will dive into a non-verbal space and let our bodies do the rest.


  Itâ€™s great if you already have some dance and movement experience, however this space will be held accessible to all! Come as you are ðŸ™‚

  We usually have dancers with various backgrounds joining such as zouk, tango, fusion, contact improvâ€¦ etc.


  Please commit to the entire experience, especially the beginning, as we are creating a safe space and a shared vibe. The doors will close after 18.30.
