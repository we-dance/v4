  THE ZOUK ATOMS PROGRAM STARTS HERE!


  If you want to go deeper into the Zouk Basics, being able of moving in any direction dancing head movements and get real confidence about your dance, you cannot miss the Zouk Atoms Program. We have 4 modules, 30 hours each, and this is the very first one, where your atomic journey beginns.


  Already more than 100 people have started the program and the feedback is amazing. They report an improvement of their technique (leading and follower skills) and a much bigger understanding about how powerful the structure of the Zouk Basics is.


  Learn with Olga & Fernando how to have more freedom on the dance floor. Your basics would never be the same! Stop learning choreographies and start being atomic!



  === SCHEDULE ===

  - From Monday 7th to Friday 11th of July you will have classes everyday from 12:30 to 17:30 and the social starts at 20:00.


  - On Saturday 12th the classes are form 13.00 to 18.00 and the social starts at 20.30


  Prepare yourself for 30 hours of intensive zouk training!



  ===LOCATION===

  All the classes and socials will take place in our dance studio in the historic center of Bremen:

  Isla Zouk - Komturstr. 4



  === PRICE ===

  The full week with the training and the socials costs 290€ and we have only 28 spots (14 leaders/14 followers), so we can spend enough time with you (what we would love to do! ).



  === LEVEL & REGISTRATION ===

  In order to apply for the week you should have an intermediate level of zouk. Intermediate level means for us, that you should be able to dance the basics with head movements (lateral, bumerangue, etc., with head movements). Here you have a sample, how a intermediate dance level looks like:

  More than 100 dancers have taken part in this program and the feedback was amazing! Don’t miss this new chance of understanding zouk better!


  Big hug,


  Olga & Fernando

  WHAT ARE THE ZOUK ATOMS?


  The Zouk Atoms are a system to organize the footwork of Brazilian, allowing you to see the structure behind all the footwork possibilities and making you free to move in any direction and express yourself. Furthermore we show a way of dancing fluent head movements that makes you feel how smooth zouk can be.


  WHAT IS THE ZOUK ATOMS PROGRAM?


  The Zouk Atoms Program is a structured system to learn the Zouk Atoms in 4 intensive weeks :

  - Level 1: The entry level of the Zouk Atoms

  - Level 2 Position F: A module that focusses on the atoms that go to the front

  - Level 2 Position B: A module that focusses on the atoms that go backwards

  - Level 2 Position S: A module that focusses on the atoms that go sideways


  The Level 1 is the entry Level and a muss to continue learning the system. It can be visited online too:

  https://learn.zoukatoms.com/courses/zouk-atoms-level-1-intensive-week


  The Level 2 are three different modules that be visited independent from each other.


  After completing the 4 modules you get a certification from Olga & Fernando about your deep understanding of the Zouk Basics and the Head Movements.
