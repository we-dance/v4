  💞Experience real flow and deep connection in your dance💞


  ⁉️ 10-12 May 2024 in Bonn


  Have you experienced this?


  ➖You are much in the head while dancing

  ➖You feel insecure and awkward in your body

  ➖You feel no creativity in dancing and wish for variety

  ➖You feel no connection and the dance feels empty

  ➖You feel insecure and are afraid of doing something wrong while 
      dancing
  ➖You go home disappointed and unfulfilled after a long evening of 
      dancing
  ➖You put pressure on yourself and feel like you have to fit in

  ➖You go home disappointed and unfulfilled after a long evening of 
      dancing

  💞Connection Training:


  ✔️Improves your flow experience in all couple dance styles and dancing in general

  Whether Kizomba, Bachata, Salsa, Zouk, Contact or Ecstatic Dance - through this training you learn to feel yourself better and can therefore follow or lead better and experience more flow.


  ✔️Your body perception is trained

  Through movement you get to know your body better. You direct your attention to yourself and explore new possibilities. Through our body awareness training you gain access to your feelings and your needs, as you begin to feel yourself more again.


  ✔️You have time for yourself and to cultivate conscious encounters

  the hectic everyday life, between university, work or family often distracts us from taking the time for ourselves and for mindful encounter.


  ✔️Strengthens the sense of community

  When you share your passion for something with someone, you quickly find yourself on the same wavelength, allowing you to form deeper connections


  ✔️Has a positive effect on mental health

  It helps you to reduce stress, strengthens your endurance, flexibility, muscles and joints. Dancing is healing for your soul, it is not for nothing that it is also used in certain therapy areas to release blockades, to take away fears or to give people a sense of life again 😉


  ✔️You will feel fulfilled, nourished and refueled

  The kind of bodywork and dance we teach at Connection Training brings you closer to yourself and strengthens your self-love. The deep and nurturing connection in dance with others that this creates is indescribable and magical.


  ➖3 days training with embodiment, conscious connections, Brazilian Zouk & Kizomba

  That moment when you feel really fulfilled after dancing, you know it? Do you want more of that? Do you want to feel more flow and connection in your dancing?


  ➖Whether it’s Zouk, Kizomba, Bachata, Salsa or dancing on your own, this workshop will help you make the flow not only come spontaneously, but you will learn specific methods to bring you into the flow and strengthen the connection with yourself and your dance partner.


  ➖Dancing without connection can be very frustrating and feel “empty”. In our workshop you will learn to cultivate conscious encounters in dance, train yourself in conscious touch and feel how you can positively influence your dance through your inner attitude.



  ➖Experience real aliveness and connectedness

  This training is very enriching for all who dance couple dances, but also very valuable without previous couple dance experience. No dance partner is necessary, we rotate through.


  ➖You can also make great use of all the methods to improve your relationship with other people beyond dancing.


  ➖Connection Training will bring you fully into your body and into connection with yourself. From there, we will show you effective connection tools to experience a fulfilling connection with others.


  ➖Friday and Saturday evenings there will be Zouk & Kizomba dance parties with previous workshops for beginners + intermediate/advanced.Experience real aliveness and connectedness
