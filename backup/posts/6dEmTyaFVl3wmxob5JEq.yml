  Ola and Oeslle are Brazilian Zouk and Lambada teachers based in London. They started their partnership in June 2022 and today they spread their knowledge locally and internationally at many festivals including Warsaw Zouk Festival, Stockholm Lambada Festival, Beach Festival Barcelona, Transylvania Zouk Festival. This year they also organized the first edition of Lamba London Weekender.


  Ola is a Brazilian Zouk and Lambada instructor, and dancer with over 18 years of experience in dancing. She was a member of the WARSAW ZOUK COMPANY, whose show was presented at the largest European festivals - Madrid Zouk Bachata Congress, ZoukTime Brno, and Warsaw Brasil Festival. She is a physiotherapist by profession, which is why she pays attention to conscious and safe work with the body. What she appreciates the most in Brazilian Zouk is the variety of emotions, freedom, and musicality the dance brings in.


  Oeslle is originally from Brazil and specializes in teaching Brazilian Zouk and Lambada. In 2017, he joined the studio Barracão da Dança where he was trained by Daniel Darbello, Matheus Franco, and Nina Darbello. Oeslle is also a researcher that works with AI for bra imaging. He is very analytical and uses a lot of brain hacks to teach and develop his dance. He loves the freedom he can find in Brazilian Zouk and also values a lot of the structure of Lambada.
