  We are planning an exciting Sydney Summer Kiz Festival for all the Kizombies to enjoy! We will be featuring workshops in Kizomba Fusion, Urban Kiz, and Tarraxo. All workshops with international teachers will be at least 75 mins long. 


  We will also be featuring a discussion session at the end of each day with our teachers. This is a great opportunity to ask anything about Urban Kiz, Fusion and Tarraxo. These sessions have always been popular among our Kizombies.
