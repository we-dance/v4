  Boot camps are an exciting way to try a new dance style and to start the
  season!


  Join us for an introduction to Kizomba&Semba and/or Urbankiz on Saturday, February 1st. We're excited to guide you through your first steps, sharing the knowledge and passion we've cultivated over years of dancing and teaching. Welcome to start this journey with us!


  These 2h Beginner Boot camps are absolute beginner friendly. No previous experience needed. Even though it is a couple dance, you don't need to have your own partner, you will be paired up with other students and we will rotate partners throughout the classes.


  We offer you to choose one of two or take both:


  12:30-14:40 - KIZOMBA & SEMBA Boot camp with Tatjana and Aretta

  14:50-17:00 - URBANKIZ Boot camp with Tatjana and Juri.


  We are happy to see more experienced dancers joining us to welcome newcomers and polish the basics or trying a new role in dance.


  Register before January 7th with an EARLY BIRD discount - 20%OFF:

  One of boot camps 2h - 24€

  Both boot camps 4h - 40€


  PAYMENT OPTIONS:

  To save time before classes, we encourage payments to be made online through our webpage. We also accept Epassi, Edenred, and Smartum payments, which can be processed online and emailing us with your payment details. Anyway, for your comfort we take also card and cash payments at the school.


  NOTE!

  It's a dance school equipped with a hardwood floor. Please bring indoor shoes or be ready to dance in socks.


  The door code for entry downstairs is 7302, and we're located on the fourth floor.
