  Last few months our team was working on a new update: website got a new fresh
  look, more filters, simplified registration, tips on editing profiles, posts
  and events. 


  Website is now available in 7 languages: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Turkish and Russian. Let us now if something is wrong, we don't have professional translators in our team yet.


  ### New Profiles


  - profiles got a new clear address

  - markdown support in the description: you can make text bold, italic, add lists, headers, links, images and widgets such add instagram, gumroad, youtube and wedance profile

  - list of your events and posts

  - social media buttons: make sure you use usernames in contacts section and not full urls

  - objectives: what are you up to do with a dance partner


  ### Publish to social media to gain more attention


  Go to Settings and edit profile:


  - upload photo

  - make your teaser short, up to 280 symbols

  - choose dance styles

  - select profile type

  - change visibility to public


  Hit Save and you will get an offer to be published on our social media feed.


  ### Trends


  Trends is a new Home and Feed. Now you see posts from anywhere sorted by most popular. You can filter posts by city and dance style. 


  Once you choose city you can join a city chat.


  ### Community


  People page became Community, which now includes not only dancers, but also artists, venues and organisers. Coming for the first time to this page you will see profiles from Anywhere.


  ### Your voice matters!


  We are continuously working on improving your experience on the platform, and our goal is to make it easy for you to find dance partners and events. You are welcome to [Get Involved](http://bit.ly/wedance-start) – we are looking for volunteers.
