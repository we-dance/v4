  BACKGROUND


  Interfusion Festival was founded in 2016 under The Institute for Integrative Wellness (IFIW). Since that time, it has become the primary indoor transformative festival of North America bringing together the like-minded from across the US and beyond on Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. It is a grassroots community-centered creative project with more than twenty percent of participants involved in the creative or services process that bring Interfusion to life.


  FESTIVAL LOCATION


  A modern day oasis. The festival takes place at the Crystal Gateway Marriott located at 1700 Richmond Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. This 4.5-star hotel is located just minutes from Washington, D.C. and Reagan National Airport (DCA). While not required for festival participation, it is recommended that travelers consider staying at the hotel to emerge into the complete community experience. Learn more on our plan page:

  DAYTIME EXPERIENCE


  During the daytime explore workshops across multiple programs that are carefully designed for both individual and shared learning experiences, from beginners to advanced offerings. While no partner required to participate, partnerships may be formed during workshops, with workshop facilitators often providing an option to rotate with others to create the best learning environment possible.
