  At the marathon, we emphasize the traditional social tango etiquette, invitations by mirada and cabeceo, maintaining a careful and fluid dance ronda, leaving the floor during the cortina and changing partner at each tanda.

  The afternoon milongas are free sitting, while the evening milongas are organized sitting, with leaders, followers and mixed areas. We believe in the magic generated from any of these ways of living the milonga.
