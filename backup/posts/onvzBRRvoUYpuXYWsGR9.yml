  The Zoukarium marathon is a event organized by friends for friends. Due to its nature as a friends-only event and the limited availability of spaces, tickets will initially be available only through invitation codes. In a second step, ticket sales will be opened to the public.


  PS: If you know someone who is participating in the event, feel free to ask them for an invitation code.
