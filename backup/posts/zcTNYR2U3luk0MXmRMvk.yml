  💫 𝐓𝐄𝐀𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐑

  💃  𝐈𝐥𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐧𝐚

  Ilse is an enthusiastic (MAC certified) Brazilian Zouk instructor from the land of the stroopwaffles.

  Over the years Ilse has trained in various dance styles, starting with musical classes at 12 years old, and hiphop throughout her youth, hence her love for drama and groove. She has been dancing for 13 years and teaching for 7.

  Ilse credits the growth she’s been able to see in her dance to her home school of TotallyZouk and teachers the likes of Ruanita Santos, Felipe Nascimento, Thayna trovick, Val & Vanessa, Freddy & Andressa, Leo Chaffe, Julinha, Lisa d.v.d. Plaats, and Alex de Carvalho. 


  Ilse is known for her creativity, connection, and playfulness in her dance. As a teacher today, she brings these same qualities. Years of hospitality work has taught her the empathy and knowledge of the human nature she uses to connect with and guide students. Her goals in class are to leave people with more body-awareness, self-confidence and a smile on their face.
