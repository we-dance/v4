  Very often we hear festival dancers asking what is that special about Prague Kizz Marathon. The short answer is simple: we care about social dancing and quality in every single detail. That‚Äôs why our guests come back every year and edition.


  ‚úÖ Prague Kizz Marathon is a family like event with friendly and relaxed atmosphere where there are no strangers, only friends you haven‚Äôt met yet.


  ‚úÖ We are focused only on social dancing.

  No one will interrupt your dancing, we do not have shows, MC‚Äôs & animations, nor workshops. Our parties last 12 to 18 hours in a row and our artists are great and famous world DJs.


  ‚úÖ Imagine if every single dance with a new partner was just amazing.

  Our event has limited spots and we thoroughly choose our guests based on their social dancing level, country of residence, gender and other diversity of background. You will meet here the best social dancers from up to 40 countries from all over the world.


  ‚úÖ We believe all our guests come because of the same love & passion for dancing, not to show off. We do not support ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù guest lists of invited dancers just because they dance well.


  ‚úÖ Our event is with food & soft drinks all-inclusive, straight at the dancefloor.

  Food is one of the most important social aspects and our dancers love to eat & dance. We also care about every diet - gluten, lactose free, vegetarian or vegan.


  ‚úÖ Our spacious venue has professional wooden dancefloor for ballroom competitions.

  You can spend the whole day & night dancing nonstop and your feet won‚Äôt hurt like from dancing on tiles or concrete.


  ‚úÖ We have our own high-professional sound system with wide frequency sound range, often used for concert halls.


  ‚úÖ We balance the gender.

  We don‚Äôt like to see women hunting men for a dance and standing in a queue for a good leader. This is why we do not hire and pay TAXI dancers, we do not need them. Our philosophy is that dancers should dance because of love and passion for dancing and not for money.


  ‚úÖ We have created own marathon platform.

  Our guests can choose their food and diet requirements, share flight details to meet others at the airport and share a cab, or offer their accommodation and find a roommate for the weekend and save some money.


  IMPORTANT: Prague Kizz Marathon is highly addictive üòç


  Looking forward to meeting you, Zdenek & Prague Kizz team

  Pioneers and leaders in SBKZ marathons since 2014
