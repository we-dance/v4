  Experience a two-week Bachata retreat in the heart of the Dominican Republic, fully immersed in the authentic culture, music, and dance. Unlike large bachata festivals, our bachata camp offers a close-knit, family atmosphere. We learn in small groups, live together, and explore the country, all while prioritizing high-quality instruction and the personal progress of each student. It's a journey filled with learning, fun, and unforgettable new experiences!


  In BailaMar Bachata Camp program:

  * About 30 hours of dance classes: bachata, merengue, bolero, music etc.

  * Paradise beaches! Different every day!

  * Local parties every night!

  * Exploring Dominican Republic from different sides: 

  beautiful nature with its calm or wavy ocean, forests, waterfalls, caves, animals.

  Real Caribbean life as it is, culture, history and music, food and drinks!

  All about the Dominican Republic in one tour!
