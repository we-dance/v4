  =============


  ✨ CHOICE OF 6, 7 OR 10 NIGHTS ✨


  By popular demand, we have added the option of 7 or 10 nights, so you can extend your time in the sun! 


  Our main holiday will continue to take place as normal from 15-21 April, however, with additional days offered beforehand:


  📆 7 night option (14-21 April)

  📆 10 nights option (11-21 April)


  For those of you who just can't get enough Costa Del Salsa, the first portion of the holiday will be a little bit of a warm-up for the main event. 


  From 11th-15th April, you will be joined by Rohan Brown, Rasa Pauzaite, Sagi Iluz and Piret Annus and your days will be filled with 2-3 hours of classes, some fun activities and an opportunity to soak up the sunshine. Every evening, we will dance the night away in local SBK club, Atreveté until the early hours of the morning! We will also participate in Atreveté's evening classes, giving you a chance to learn along with the locals before the main holiday begins! 


  =============


  ✨ WHAT TO EXPECT ✨


  Under the expert stewardship of Piret Annus, you will enjoy a programme of over 50 classes, in cross body salsa, cuban salsa, rueda de casino, kizomba, bachata, cha cha, reggaeton, bachatango, Latin hustle, threesomes and more! And when the sun goes down, you can dance the night away at our social dances every evening, featuring amazing shows and entertainment.
