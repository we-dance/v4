  Every month we will be running Salsa and Bachata parties at Laluna bar and in September we welcome not one but four amazing guests with the incredible Emily Prysak, Jenny Curran and if that wasn't enough the one and only Biskit and Paola!!! Congress level teachers and music for parties on a weekend!


  We have some the best in the UK in Biskit & Paola and Emil & Jenny who will not only be bringing you some awesome guest Classes. Biskit and Paola will also be doing a 1 hour workshop beforehand too! 


  As well as this James and co. will be teaching Salsa and Bachata to those of you who are absolute beginners! 


  Then our crsbdy team will bring the music and the party for another big night of Salsa and Bachata.


  It's going to be a huge night and we cannot wait to party with you all again!


  ⭐️Remember 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝘀! So make sure you book up before the night. Link in above👆


  A massive venue with a great dance floor, Laluna has the capacity to hold hundreds of dancers and has a fully stocked bar to keep you well hydrated throughout the night. It is all set up to be a great night.


  As well as a class from our special guest teacher we also have beginners Salsa and Bachata classes with our regular teachers for those who have not tried Salsa and Bachata before!


  Then after the classes are over the party begins playing the best Salsa and Bachata music to social dance to until 1am‼️ 


  The music policy is 50:50 but adapts to the crowd throughout the night and we also play sprinklings of Kizomba.
