  THE APPLICATION PERIOD FOR THE PINA BAUSCH FELLOWSHIP 2024 HAS STARTED


  From January 15 to March 15, 2024, artists in the field of dance and choreography once again have the opportunity to apply for the Pina Bausch Fellowship for Dance and Choreography â€“ all dance forms are welcome.


  Once again, the fellowship programm supports a wide range of cooperation formats: the fellowships can be realised on site with the cooperation partners, but can also take place virtually or hybrid. Through the different possibilities, the fellowship adapts to the individual situation of the artists and offers them the freedom to further develop their unique artistic style through mentoring, exchange and new experiences.
