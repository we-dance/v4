  ### Reviews


  > Viktoria: Alex gives a great Salsa lesson for very beginners. I can highly recommend it, because he teaches not only basic steps, but gives a lot of information about Salsa. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing. 

  I will definitely take more lessons with Alex as soon as I am back in Munich.


  > Masha: Montuno Club is the perfect place to start learning salsa - even for the real beginners with no dancing skills. Alexey is giving as much staff as needed so that you don't get bored, but also don't get overwhelmed. It's a very nice and friendly atmosphere here. As a nice bonus, Alex gives his best not only to teach you salsa, but also to introduce the salsa/dance world of Munich to you and connect all dancers together within a community. He also arranges rueda evenings where people with different knowledge and skills get togetger and enjoy dancing. As a bonus #2, you learn a bit of Spanish ðŸ™‚ I strongly recommend Montuno club for everyone who would like to start dancing/keep dancing ðŸ™‚
