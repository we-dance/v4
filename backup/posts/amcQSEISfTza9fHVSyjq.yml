  ## What is Salsa Jam?


  It's similar to a [jam session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session), i.e. informal dance event, where dancers share moves, improvise and exchange.


  ## Who can join?


  Everyone can join! It's open level. Maximum 5 couples. Pre-registration is required.


  - You know some cool combination to share with others – join!

  - You found an interesting combination on youtube and would like to practice it – join!

  - You just want to learn something new – join!


  It's a salsa practice hour, where you can  not only enjoy dancing, but also improve.


  ## How much does it cost?


  It's for free


  ## How does it work?


  Maybe you have seen street hip-hop events where dancers go in the middle of a circle and 

  perform? We do the same! Everyone gets his time to shine in the middle and we all together decide who we want to learn from.


  - Music never stops

  - There are no teachers and everyone is equal

  - We start with dance battle on the stage

  - The winner of the battle starts a session

  - Session lasts for 5-15 minutes and we repeat


  ## Hygiene Rules


  - At the same time, change your dance partners as little as possible

  - Disinfect your hands often

  - Stay at home when you're sick
