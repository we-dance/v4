  We know, you just as us, are kind of unused to dancing after one year of
  pandemic and lockdowns everywhere. We need you to get back on track! We aspire
  to guide you in your preparation for the Berlin Salsacongress 2021. That`s why
  we created a series of ONLINE APPETIZERS with some of the BEST international
  INSTRUCTORS in our community! With amazing artists such as Ernesto & Denisse
  (New York), Terry & Cecile (Marseille/Paris) or Andy & Yuliet (Oslo), to just
  name a few. Many of those Online Appetizers are aiming at partnerwork, but
  some you can also join as individual dancer. They will cover Mambo, Cuban,
  Bachata, Ladies Style and Bodymovement.


  We are truly proud that we brought together such an amazing list of great artists in our community to warm you up on your way to the Summer Edition of Berlin Salsacongress 2021!
