  • The Morabeza Kizomba Weekend Nairobi is a 3 day celebration of Kizomba’s unique African heritage and cultural tourism, with the goal of solidifying regional cooperation in the realm of dance and culture among African countries.


  • ' Morabeza ' (Cabo Verde) is the Portuguese word for hospitality, but it is also a concept that isn’t defined in any dictionary, but rather loosely characterized by having a positive disposition and approach towards people and life in general. It is more akin to the Hawaiian word and concept of ‘Aloha’. Like Aloha and the spirit it embodies, Morabeza is about love and compassion - indeed a positive way of living and outlook on life.


  • For us, the term ‘Morabeza’ encompasses a hospitable, relaxed and friendly energy that speaks to the soul of a people. The Morabeza Kizomba Weekend Nairobi translates this energy as a promise of solidarity that prevails in both pleasant and trying times through acts of kindness, love, empathy and hospitality towards one another.


  • We believe that this promise is found in its purest state when we dance Kizomba. In our quest to go through life; communities can sometimes grow competitive and become divided. We are to work together and make ourselves vulnerable with each other to allow the promise of kindness, love, hospitality and friendship to guide in this quest.
