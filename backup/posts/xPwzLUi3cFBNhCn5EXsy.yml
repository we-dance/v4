  The magic of Zouk is back in town! And this time it wants to help you see your
  own magic :)


  Together with Raoni and Leticia from Brazil and with Lilly from Lithuania.




  𝗥𝗮𝗼𝗻𝗶 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝘁𝗶́𝗰𝗶𝗮 are a standout pair in the dance world, known for their dedication to providing technical yet relaxed dance classes that prioritize comfort, safety, and the fluidity of movement. Their teaching style combines precision with a light-hearted approach, creating an environment where students can feel at ease while learning deeply.


  With over 20 years of experience, Raoni, a licensed dance instructor with a degree in Physical Education, and Letícia, a former gymnast with more than 10 years of dance experience and degrees in Literature and School Administration, have earned a reputation for their unique style. They specialize in Brazilian Zouk and Samba de Gafieira, two styles where their connection and harmony truly shine.


  Together, they have taught in eight countries across Europe, the United States, and Brazil, where they’ve also run their prestigious dance school for the past 13 years. Most recently, they were awarded in both Zouk and Samba at a national competition in Brazil, a testament to their shared dedication and expertise.




  𝐋𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐲 is an intuitive mystic and passionate dancer of all kinds. She started with ballet when she was a kid and later she discovered Kizomba, then Bachata, Salsa, and the latest - Zouk. She has been on the social dance floor for the last 12 years (16 years total in dancing) and still counting 🙂 As Lilly says - she dances everything her partner leads, as her high sensitivity to life gives her a great sense of musicality and telepathic intuition.




  𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐢𝐟:


  1. You want to explore Brazilian Zouk and experience the beauty of this dance style (open level).

  5. You want to understand how to truly access the connection with yourself and your partner!

  6. You want to be able to enter another dimension of dancing, with a lot of comfort, a lot of freedom, and being able to express yourself freely.
