  After a more than successful first Edition, Kizomba Queen Weekend becomes
  Kizomba Queen Festival and offers a unique edition in the heart of
  Torremolinos in a beautiful place, five minutes from the airport.

  At the same level of the best festivals in Europe, we guarantee a good balance and the best dancers.

  Join the Kizomba Queen family and let's create moments to be remembered forever ❤
   
  What can you expect?
   
  Kizomba Queen offers the unique opportunity for kizomba queens from all over the world to dance, relax and be treated as the queen you are. 

  The workshops that will be given, will largely be focussed on women, with ladystyling and bodymovement being the main subject. We have invited amazing female teachers to make sure you get the best out of your time with us.

  Additionally, we have invited some of the best male dancers and couples. 

  And after a long day of doing workshops, dancing and a good (but short) night of sleeping, we will offer yogaclasses to reconnect with yourself.
