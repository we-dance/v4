  BSI Dans-Kizomba & Urbankiz present our biggest event this fall! 

  This weekend includes five hours of workshops with Juneline & Virgile, one workshop with our very own Varun and Iliana, as well as BSI Dans instructors Ajith and Runa for bachata. We also have parties every evening🥳


  💃🏻 OUR INSTRUCTORS 🕺


  -Juneline & Virgile 

  -Iliana & Varun

  -Runa & Ajith


  🔗BIO-Main instructors🔗


  Virgile and Juneline are two of the finest Dutch urban kiz teachers around, known for their fluidity, elegant technique and precision in teaching. They will help you get awareness in your technique to elevate your skills. They can see and feel every weightshift, framehold, connection and that information is needed to become better. They teach weekly classes in Amsterdam and in Almere at their own dance school License2Kizz. 


  Virgile

  Virgile started dancing kizomba in 2015. In the beginning of 2016 he found his passion in Urban Kiz and changed his teaching style to Urban Kiz. As from that day on, he still trains and practices and loves to teach UrbanKiz on a weekly basis. Virgile is the founder of License2Kizz. Together with June he travels the world to share their knowledge and fundamentals to improve your UrbanKiz.

  His style can be described as technical playfull and but most important he wants to create a musical story with his follower/dance partner.


  Juneline

  Juneline has a background in belly dance and has performed for years before she started with Kizomba. She has been teaching Urban kiz, Body Movement and Ladies Styling for over more than 5 years now. In addition, she loves to travel the world to build up women and their self-confidence through dance. Her dance style is elegant, expressive and fluid even in her following style. Together with Virgile she has built up License2Kizz as a brand and a place where people become better dancers. She believes that their fundamentals and principles in Urban Kiz will help you improve every time you use them.
