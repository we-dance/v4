  ----------------------------


  DC Cherry Blossom Kizomba Weekender (CBKW) is a unique celebration of spring, life, music, dance, culture, community, African roots, authentic connections, and international unity. CBKW features 3 days of dance classes, 4 nights of evening dance parties, and various social activities.


  Dance and music genres represented at CBKW include Urban Kiz, Kizomba, Tarraxo, Konpa and Afrobeat. Providing plenty of challenge and creative opportunities to the experienced dancers as well as safe and supportive learning space for those just getting started on their dance journeys, CBKW is a welcoming place for dancers of all skill and experience levels.


  Taking place at the end of March in the greater Washington DC area, CBKW is also a great opportunity visit the Capital at its most beautiful time of the year and enjoy the renowned DC Cherry Blossom Festival and the region‚Äôs enlivening spring weather.


  While celebrating the roots and birthplace cultures of each dance, and international influences that shape and define the dances to their current forms, CBKW prides itself on spotlighting North America based talent. Each year, CBKW‚Äôs world-class lineup of artists is selected with careful consideration of not only artistic skill, level, and acclaim, but also each artist‚Äôs contributions to building their local dance communities, nurturing the culture(s), and providing positive leadership in the local, national, and international community discourse.


  At CBKW, we not only believe, but know, from the deep in our bones, the transformational power of dance to engage, educate, unite and to be a vessel for personal growth and positive social change. We harness that power to create experiences that help build bridges of understanding, awareness, care, and appreciation for the cultures of the dances and the people of the cultures all while having good wholesome fun. Held during the last weekend of the Women‚Äôs History Month, CBKW places special emphasis on celebrating and spotlighting female artists and leaders.


  CBKW is not just a hot party, it‚Äôs a hot party with a message!
