  🔹🔹🔹WALF Devon welcomes you to its 6th Edition of Winter Afro-Latin Festival. Join us as we celebrate with a collaboration of SALSA, BACHATA, KIZOMBA , URBANKIZ & AFRO-HOUSE and many more with incredible line up of both International and Local Teachers, and Dj’s to keep you entertained all the weekend. We will have 4 dance floors available, a late licence and late bar to allow you to keep dancing and drinking through the night.

We have both International and Local teachers, all there to share their expertise with you.


  🎇About THE ROYAL HOTEL:✅

  Just opposite from the beach and the famous Grand Pier, THE ROYAL HOTEL, Weston-super-Mare is a spectacular hotel that overlooks the sea. The ideal place for a seaside holiday where you can get the benefit of the beach experience plus the buzz of the beachfront.


  🎆WESTON SUPER MARE ✅

  Weston-Super-Mare is a seaside resort town in North Somerset showcasing both Victorian history and long stretches of sandy beaches. Ideally located to explore all that North Somerset has to offer including Clevedon’s Grade I listed pier and Portishead’s lively marina. Weston has all the perks of a seaside town including a pier, ideal swimming spots, lovely restaurants and some of the very best fish and chips around! It's also very easy to access by both car, train and flight - there is a railway station in the town centre and Weston is just off the M5 at Junction 21.
