  Saturday Afternoon Dance Development Workshops

  Next Date 6th April 2024

  Dancing On Clave


  Our next workshop is an amazing exploration of the heart of the salsa dance we love so much. Clave which means ‘key’ in Spanish is literally at the heart of the music and connects the musicians to each other and us, as dancers, to the music.


  Our Saturday afternoon workshops are a great opportunity to explore the music and gain a deeper understanding of how we dance and connect to the wealth of amazing music that is available. If you would like to develop your connection to the music and the excitement that comes with that understanding then be sure to join us on the 6th April.


  Our workshop on the 6th is only the beginning as our future workshops will focus on developing Advanced and intermediate dancers in a number of different areas including, Son bass'd mambo where we explore the son basis of dancing mambo (Classic Mambo). In addition we will explore the music foundation of dancing on Clave, Cha Cha Cha, Boogaloo, Contra Tiempo, New York On2, Body Movement, Pachanga, Musicality, Afro Cuban Movement, Advanced Partnerwork, Footwork and Shines etc.


  Our teaching team has a collective experience spanning over 2 decades and is committed to your dance learning and development. There will be 2 levels covering intermediate and advanced dancers and we will ensure that dancers are at the correct level appropriate to participate in each level. If you are in any doubt about what level will be the right level for you then please contact Basil for further information. To book your place please visit our website at www.dance2salsa.co.uk.
