  8:30 pm - Absolute Beginner lesson

  Bring your friends who don't know how to dance yet, and show them what it is all about :)


  9 pm - 12 am - dance the night away!


  We are happy to bring back a wonderful live band Nosotros. Nosotros is one of the most recognizable Latin bands in the Southwest United States and increasingly beyond. The band seamlessly combines Latin rhythms - cumbia, salsa, bolero, etc. - with elements of rock and jazz creating an innovative and imaginative Latin sound that is unique, undefinable and unmistakably Nosotros. What began as a teenaged guitar trio in 1994, quickly took on a life of its own, organically developing and growing into something that no one could have predicted or set out to create, drawing music lovers to their music for nearly three decades. Nosotros continue to this day to astound audiences wherever they perform. And, importantly, their new music continues to be vibrant, fun and relevant, reflecting our ever-changing world.


  Dress to impress and get ready to party! 

  The fiesta and absolute beginner lesson are free and open to public!

  This is a fiesta you wonâ€™t want to miss!
