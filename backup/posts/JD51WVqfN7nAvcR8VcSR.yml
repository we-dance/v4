  RAONI and LETÍCIA BONANÇA all the way from São Paulo, Brazil!!!

  We are SO EXCITED to announce RAONI and LETICÍA’s first-ever time to MANCHESTER to share with us a wealth of BRAZILIAN ZOUK knowledge, all the way from the heart of ZOUK, BRAZIL.

  WHO ARE RAONI and LETÍCIA BONANÇA??

  Together, Raoni and Letícia run the BIGGEST DANCE SCHOOL in their city, Santo André, SÃO PAULO, and are great promoters of ZOUK, organizing a lot of events and dance shows. They have appeared in famous magazines and TV shows in BRAZIL and run an AWARD-WINNING DANCE COMPANY. As one of the only couples working with SAMBA AND ZOUK simultaneously with such commitment, they have already TOURED FOUR TIMES INTERNATIONALLY in EUROPE and the UNITED STATES.

  With Raoni's long career as a dancer and Letícia's experience in education, their classes stand out for being didactically structured, which facilitates the learning process, and are also technical and fun. Much emphasis is placed on teaching students to dance comfortably and safely.
