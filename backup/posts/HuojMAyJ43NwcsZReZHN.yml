  🎉Join us for our 1 Year Anniversary!🎉


  🎉We are thrilled to announce that Killa Kiz is celebrating its 1 Year Anniversary! We launched our events in Reading with last years International Dance Day event which became the start of Killa Kiz' class and party events. It is unbelievable how much our events have attracted dancers far and wide across the UK and we are extremely grateful for your support.


  🎉To celebrate this day we are hosting our 'WILD PARTY.' We all love a party so this event is 6 hours of pure social dancing with 2 of our UK's much loved DJ's ~ DJ Visser & DJ After Party. These two will certainly be bringing you all the vibes! Playing the best of Kizomba, Urban Kiz, Ghetto zouk, Tarraxo and more.

  A regular feature to our events we have our incredible Killa Kiz Taxi Team who will be sure to keep you on the dancefloor throughout the night! Also celebrating with us we have an array of special guests across the UK - organisers, teachers, DJ's, promoters etc who do a great job in contributing to our Kiz scene.


  To catch these great moments on the night is the super talented photographer Karen Chau. She will be capturing us in the wildest party to come to Reading!


  Doors open at 6pm.
