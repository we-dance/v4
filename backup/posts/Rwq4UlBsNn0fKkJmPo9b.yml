description: We offer a combination of Salsa Workshop and Salsa Party. At the
  beginning, basic steps and simple figures are on the program. These are then
  supplemented and refined in the course of the workshop until we arrive at
  longer, challenging combinations together. The support of the individual dance
  couples is carried out individually at their respective level. While the
  beginners are still working on the basic step and the simple variants, the
  advanced ones are about mastering more complex combinations and then dancing
  in such a way that it looks casual and good - even in a confined space. Each
  couple decides for themselves up to which level they want to practice.  Free
  dancing to music. We go from couple to couple and give tips or show more
  "moves" if desired.

  Los Angeles (L.A.) Style is danced "on 1" and is a variant of the dynamic
  "Cross Body Lead" style. The figures are danced "on the line". The L.A. style
  can be expanded as desired up to spectacular show figures, which makes it
  particularly popular in cinema productions, competitions and dance
  tournaments. By the way, most of the figures of the L.A. style can be easily
  adapted to other dances such as ChaCha or Rumba.


  You can also come alone with your partner. A balanced ratio between men and women can be expected.


  As always, the program is on a donation basis (donation recommendation 10 â‚¬)
