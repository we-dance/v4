  💫 𝐓𝐄𝐀𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐒

  🕺 𝐊𝐫𝐢𝐬 𝐋𝐞𝐜𝐳𝐞𝐤 

  Kris is an international dance instructor, certified by UKA organization in Great Britain and first certified SoulZouk instructor in Europe. The basics Kris teaches are comfort, guidance, contact and pleasure. His dance style is rooted in the Brazilian SoulZouk based on organic movement and celebration of the "beautiful chaos" of dance and all that it brings: connection, creativity, musicality, fun, inspiration and improvisation. The main compass in dance is intuition and empathy for another person, not the precision of performing known movements and dance combinations. SoulZouk uses biomechanics and knowledge of anatomy to create an infinite number of elements and a constantly evolving form.

  Since 2003, Kris has been fascinated by conscious movement and connection at the level of the body, the spirit and the source. Kris's dance teachings are heavily influenced by many practices such as meditation, Qigong, Tai Chi as well as dance therapy and contact improvisation. His dance path focuses not only on movement, but also on inner growth, fostering sensitivity and empathy towards his partner and the world.


  💃 𝐊𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐏𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐜 

  Klaudia is a passionate Brazilian Zouk dance instructor. During the last few years Klaudia has been dancing in Europe and Asia gaining knowledge about different Zouk styles, including SoulZouk, Lambazouk and traditional Zouk. She is also a dancer of Modern Jazz, Impro and Fusion. She learnt Zouk from the best Zouk dancers worldwide, e.g. the creator of SoulZouk - China. When teaching Zouk, Klaudia puts special emphasis on grounding, hip movements, body isolations, connection and flow. Her pedagogical experience helps in passing the knowledge amongst students. According to her, the combination of dance technique and feeling constitutes the beauty of this dance and it is this idea that she wants to transfer you.
