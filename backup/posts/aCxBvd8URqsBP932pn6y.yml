  --- WeDance SPECIAL OFFER - GET 15€ DISCOUNT WITH THE PROMOCODE "WeDance" ---


  Our mission has always been to bring dancers together from all over the world for a weekend of dance in Berlin. Now we go a step further and invite you to join us in plain summer! We can't offer you beach or sea or pool parties. True that. But we will offer you to dance outdoors in the sun in daytime with a breathtaking view including the sunset and to live your passion at night indoors on up to three dancefloors. Located in a city which is truly reachable from all over Europe and in a location which is easily accessible from the airport and main station.


  We will offer you what we can do best: Focusing on high level Social Dancing from midday to midnight (and longer on Saturday), a bunch of amazing Choreography Bootcamps for the super advanced and adding a number of workshops for those who want to improve their skills, and we will be featuring once again the best Stargate Shows in our community. On Sunday we will present the results of the bootcamps and the winner of the Stargate Shows, but there won't be no more shows beside those six shows.


  You will meet an amazing line up of some of the best instructors in our worldwide community on the spot in Berlin. Additionally to offer you even more we will have some great artists streamed to Berlin for some exclusive workshops:


  - Ernesto & Denisse (New York

  - De'Jon & Clo (New Orleans)

  - Terry & Cecile (Marseille/Paris)

  - Andy & Yuliet (Oslo)


  All those which have already purchased their passes will receive also receive exclusive access to some online classes with those instructors before the event in June and July.
