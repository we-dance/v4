  Dear kizomberos and kizombeiras, I hereby invite you to my birthday bash!


  Our aim is to provide you with an extraordinary experience. Due to the scale of this event, I will not refer to it as a festival, instead I'll label it as a "Weekender Experience".


  Do you want to attend some workshops and work on your technique? We have assembled an amazing line-up of outstanding instructors to share with you high-quality knowledge. 


  Do you want to be kept up and dancing until the early morning hours? Our talented DJs will make sure that happens. 


  Do you enjoy your dancing experiences with a little bit of spice? We are also bringing international guest dancers into the mix.


  And if you're considering a visit to Cluj, now is the perfect time! The event is set to take place right in the heart of Cluj-Napoca.
