  🎫 Tickets Refund Policy

  Make sure you purchase the correct ticket, since you purchase them as non-refundable and bound to your name. In case you are unable to attend on short notice due to medical reasons, please provide medical proof from your doctor, so we can transfer your ticket to another ZoukCologne event.

  Before buying a ticket make sure the seller has an actual ticket tailor ticket from our event.

  Usually we update the schedule to make it even better for you and easier to attend. Also teacher’s travel arrangements change unexpectedly and event locations become unavailable on short notice. So the schedule is subject to change! Please check for updates. We will update you on several channels, including our event whatsapp groups, facebook event and ZoukCologne instagram.

  Filming and photography might take place during the event. By attending the event you consent to filming and photography of yourself as a member of the attendees, as well as publication and broadcast.
