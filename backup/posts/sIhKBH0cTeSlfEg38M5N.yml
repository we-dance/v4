description: >-
  Douceur is a sub-style of Urban Kiz and gets a lot of its foundations from
  Tarraxinha. The literal translation is sweetness or softness, which also
  refers to the type of music that Douceur is mostly danced to. Douceur is often
  experienced to as meditation for two. The focus lies on connection, on
  becoming one with your partner, on reaching a state where we forget what is
  around us and are being able to express music and emotions together. There is
  the misconception when seeing Douceur for the first time that nothing is
  happening, and only by experiencing it you will find what it is all about.


  Douceur at with Juli and Felix means working on the connection with ourselves and with our partner, on musicality body awareness and micro movements.
