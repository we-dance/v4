  BEGINNERS (Course)

  Advanced Booking Required

  PAYG Option available


  This is a structured 6 week course working to a syllabus.

  You will start to learn all the foundations at beginner level with good technique in a friendly relaxed environment. Everyone welcome, including two left feet, no partner or experience needed. A great way to learn something new, keep fit, meet new people and most of all have fun!


  PRACTISE TIME

  There will be 15 minutes practice time for Beginners and Improvers at the end of their class and for the Intermediate at the beginning of theirs. A great opportunity to practise your moves with music.



  IMPROVERS (Course)

  Drop-In & PAYG option available 


  The Improver‚Äôs level will continue with fundamental‚Äôs but starting to learn basic turn patterns with leading and following techniques, connection and distancing awareness. 

  This is a longer level than Beginner‚Äôs with a lot more to learn. Don‚Äôt worry, we at Salsa feel good have the knowledge and experience, plus patience to help you improve and reach your potential. 



  INTERMEDIATE (Class)
