  Things are getting dire for hospitality and night-life -

  Please support our local hospitality venues and staff - have lunch,

  get a coffee, go out for dinner, have a drink after work, catch up with some friends at your local, go enjoy a Social Dancing, band or DJ at a venue. This might be heading towards a situation of "use it or lose it".
