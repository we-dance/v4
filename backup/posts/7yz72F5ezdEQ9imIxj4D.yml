  𝑩𝑰𝑵𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑺 is an Indian slang that embodies carefree, relaxed, freethinking, and fun-filled more than mere words can express. Rooted on the context, we use the slang 𝑩𝑰𝑵𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑺 in India or with Indians.

  So, we wholeheartedly embrace some of the concepts of BINDAAS to BACHATA, hence it is named after the slang and we named it called❤️️ 𝑩𝑰𝑵𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑺 BACHATA ❤️️


  💛🖤𝑩𝑰𝑵𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑺 BACHATA focuses on delivering quality-based medium scale bachata events rather than quantity-based big commercial festivals. We strive to provide the best & quality experience for artists, DJs, participants, staff, and for everyone who directly and indirectly helps and attends our events.


  💛🖤𝑩𝑰𝑵𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑺 aims to contribute the best for Bachata Social dancing community and we work on it continuously


  💛🖤𝑩𝑰𝑵𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑺 believes more in collaboration and

  co-operations with organizers, dance schools, and individual teachers to help the bachata community to grow and become better. We believe together we can achieve better


  💛🖤Let's cherish and celebrate the Bachata Social dancing community
