story: >-
  Dancing is movement and it should be a part of everyone's life! It's like
  learning a language! Especially social dance, where communication happens
  through giving and receiving the impulses. 


  My goal is to show everyone they can dance and that will bring them more mobility, confidence and possibly help them find friends for life.


  Regular classes in Munich city center (in summer outside):


  Mondays - RoleRotation day - we teach you to lead and follow, and switch in-between


  Tuesdays - Intermediate day, 2 hours of technique, fun and interesting combinations


  Wednesdays - Beginner day, make your first bachata steps and learn the basics, find out how to progress quickly.


  Most important - have fun!!!
