story: >-
  I have always danced since I was a baby. Itâ€™s a vert improtant part of my
  life!

  I user to do ballet and hiphop for a few years.

  In the last years I was only able to attend beginners classes for standard partner dances and latin dances. But ever since I have attended weekly dance partys in order to train and have fun. Thanks to ly dance partners advices and my very intuitiv dancing style I have been able to learn new skills.
