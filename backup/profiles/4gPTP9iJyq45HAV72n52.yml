story: >-
  The community Latin Parties in Crete was created in June 2016 by people who
  love latin dances, with the aim of uniting all those who like to dance latin
  and be informed in time about latin parties and events organized in Crete.


  The community logo says it all. A couple dances in front of a really rare photo of the Sun (from the NASA archive), with Venus visible in the upper right as a dove... as symbols of beauty, positive thinking and energy... :)
