story: >-
  Paula's passion for dance started at the early age of 4 in Switzerland, where
  she began children Ballet classes and gave her first performances. Following
  her move to Madrid, she tried new styles such as Hiphop and Tap dance at
  @danzaduque. During high school, she traveled to summer dance camps such as
  @socapanyc where she had the chance of working with professional and
  international dancers such as @vikingaushi and @dexterbcarr on the production
  of Modern and Contemporary dance videos.

  While at university in Boston, Paula found a team of Salsa dancers and, in parallel, took her first Bachata classes at @sycdance.


  It wasn't until she moved to Barcelona in 2016 that she truly dedicated most of her free time to Latin dances (Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba and Zouk). Her technique and musicality was shaped by different inspiring artists such as @gaticadance, @annanavarro.dancer and @mykizbcn. Paula was also part of @wmbygatica with which she performed in congresses and events including @bcnsensualholidaystenerife, @antillabarcelona and @salavivaldi.


  In August 2019, Paula moved to Munich to become part of the @dancewithgeorge team teaching bachata intermediate/advanced levels.


  Paula is now a teaching Bachata and Zouk with her dance partner @sebastian.birk. Follow their movement on FB and Instagram @bailadictos for their classes and workshops!
