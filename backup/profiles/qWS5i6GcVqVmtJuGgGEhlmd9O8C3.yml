story: >-
  **The greatest thing that can be achieved as a dancer is when people’s feeling
  of happiness finds it’s way from their eyes and ears to their hearts**


  On a international festival I tried a workshop by Kwenda Lima because I was curious to see what Kizomba is…he called it Bodhi Kizomba. It felt like a breakthrough for me, it was the perfect combination of my ballroom dance experience and and a african rooted dance. The music touches me- makes me feel comfortable – lets me even meditate while dancing. 

  So I decided to give back my experiences, passion, positive vibes and energy by teaching Kizomba Fusion, a fusion of Kizomba, Urban Kiz and elements of ballroom dancing – as class, workshops, private lessons or even wedding dance choreography
