story: >-
  I started my dance journey in my hometown in Italy at the age of 7 with
  Ballet, Jazz Technique and Modern. 

  When I was 12 I discovered my passion for Contemporary dance and I took part in many dance workshops with international choreographers such as Alex Atzewi, Damiano Bisozzi, Marco Laudani, Anna Rita Larghi, Massimo Perugini etc. 

  I choreographed my first dance piece ( a duo)when I was 14 and I won the second place at ‚ÄúSanremo Dance Festival Competition‚Äù and Chiavari Dance Festival Competition‚Äù.

  I partecipated in various dance competitions as soloist and I won for 3 times the prize for the best stage presence. 

  At the age of 21, while I was in Munich trying and learning other styles, I fell in love with Bachata (especially Bachata Ladystyling), Salsa L.A, Heels and Lyrical Jazz, jazz funk and street jazz. 

  Regarding ‚ÄúHeels‚Äù I took some intensives with Yanis Marshall, Fraules, Galen Hooks, Jojo Gomez and many others and I‚Äôm keeping on learning almost everyday by doing also some workshops organized by ‚ÄúMunich dance workshops‚Äù. 

  I study jazz in different schools here in Munich and I take part to many dance workshops in Berlin such as ‚ÄúThe Full Out Experience‚Äù by India Rischko, the ‚ÄúMake it count‚Äù by Denis We and ‚Äúthe pure Heels intensive‚Äù organized by the Company Berlin. 

  I‚Äôm a Bachata certified instructor by Andrea & Silvia and I studied Bachata

  Ladystyling with Sara Panero, Alba Sanchez, Gatica, Nahir Romano etc. 

  I‚Äôve also danced for one year whit the international Bachata Star Melitta Siomos in the ‚ÄúPura ladies‚Äù team Munich.
