story: >-
  Passionate about dance and a dreamer who believes that everyone can learn to
  dance, João Jezuz embarked on his journey to become a professional dance
  instructor over a decade ago in Rio de Janeiro. He has shared his expertise at
  renowned dance studios such as Jaime Aroxa’s Studio, Renata Peçanha’s Studio,
  and the University of Rio. He is one of the few certified Zouk Needs You
  teachers and a BZDC Certified Judge.


  Jezuz's teaching journey has taken him to various countries and events across Europe, South America, and New Zealand. During his time in New Zealand, he founded Karioka Dance, a highly successful methodology for teaching Brazilian Dances. Now, Jezuz is based in Bremen, Germay and working along Valentina Nadj to share his passion and make a strong community.
