  I started to dance in the Netherlands when I was 3 years old. 

  My main style is Hip Hop / Street Dance but I got curious so I started to train a variety of Dance styles like Jazz, Latin, Ballroom, Heels, Salsa, Bachata,...

  After my Abitur I started my education as a dance teacher (ADTV).

  I worked on a cruise ship (AIDA) for six months and then moved to Berlin to participate in Sonia Bartuccellis Advanced Dance Program.
