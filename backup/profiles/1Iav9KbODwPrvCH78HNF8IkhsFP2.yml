story: >-
  As an Ambassador in Berlin (former Ambassador in Munich & Istanbul), WeDance
  Podcast Manager & WeDance Consul for High Heels Dance, I'm aiming to fulfill
  my passions: Dancing & Supporting the Dance Scene.


  My dance journey took shape in an oriental cultural environment. It evolved through watching Bollywood movies as a child which inspired me to be a dancer. Eventually I've started learning Kathak, an Indian Classical Dance form. Then I've proceeded with High Heels, Belly Dance, Burlesque & recently Flamenco.

  I love performing live on stage. I have experience in Burlesque Shows as well Kathak (Indian Classical Dance) & Bollywood Performances. Thanks to my teachers I had the honor to perform for Consulates & big audiences (f.e. for the Indian prime minister with hundreds of dancers of different styles & origins infront of thousands in the Audi Dome Arena in Munich as well as millions watching on TV).


  I'm still making an effort to evolve as an artist by trying different styles. From September 2022 until February 2023 I completed a 6 months Dance Certificate Program at Studio29 in Berlin. I received instruction in Jazz, Hip Hop, Ballet, Commercial, Contemporary & High Heels Dance attending eight dance classes every week. In addition, I attended workshops twice a month covering topics such as career & goal planning, audition & casting preparation, technical terminology, injury prevention & performance. During the program I was pregnant. So, the experience of learning to move with rapid & intense body changements made me grow a lot.


  I created the platform High Heels Germany with the aim to support the German High Heels Dance Community. Until now I had the chance to organize two High Heels workshops in Munich and Berlin with teachers from Germany and abroad. Planning to do more.


  As a dancer you communicate with your body movements. Dancing helps me to express myself & be free. It also helps me to explore culture & connect with people. I'm looking forward to meet & help people who share the same passion!


  If you have any questions, feel free to message me!
