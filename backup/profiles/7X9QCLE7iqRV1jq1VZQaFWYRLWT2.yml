bio: "I love dances in all their variety but most of all I love kizomba "

story: Hello everyone! I’ve come from sunny Odessa. I love dances in all their
  variety but most of all I love kizomba. I’m dancing it during three years or
  maybe more. I’ve visited were a lot of parties and festivals in the past, but
  the pandemic has interrupted this fun. And now I’m very glad to return in
  dancing life. I’m also dance bachata a little bit and I’d like to renew my
  skills in it here in Munich. See you on a dance floor!
