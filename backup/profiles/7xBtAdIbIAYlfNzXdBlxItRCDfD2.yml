story: >-
  After 15 years of dedication to  (professional) sports in the form of handball
  & tennis, I started my dance career with Salsa LA classes at Salsabor and
  OnStage in Munich in 2016. 


  Soon after, my passion for dance expanded into Bachata, which motivated me to move to Barcelona, arguably the epicenter of Bachata in Europe. There I had the chance to learn from internationally renowned dance instructors and underwent a teacher's education for Bachata Fusion by Bachata Fusion founder Frank Santos. Subsequently, I started to give classes for Bachata Fusion and went to over 50 international dance congresses to acquire new skills and elevate my level of dance and musicality. I also started to intensively study Kizomba and my now favorite dance Brazilian Zouk.


  In September 2019, I moved back to Munich where I continued to give Bachata classes at DanceWithGeorge.


  Nowadays, I am teaching Bachata and Brazilian Zouk with my partner Paula Villa Fulton from Spain. Follow us on instagram (@bailadictos) and message us if you would like to join our classes, get to know us or take private classes! Our teaching focus lies on good musical interpretation, different dynamics in the dance, appealing footwork combinations and clear and soft leading combined with fluent following.
